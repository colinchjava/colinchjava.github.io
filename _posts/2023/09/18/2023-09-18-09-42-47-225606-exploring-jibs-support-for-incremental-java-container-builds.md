Incremental builds are essential when working with large Java applications that have multiple dependencies and modules. Traditionally, when building a Docker image, the entire application is rebuilt from scratch, even if only a small part of the code has changed. This can be time-consuming, especially for large projects with a long build time.

Jib addresses this issue by leveraging the caching mechanism of the underlying container registry. It analyzes the project dependencies and layers, and carefully determines which parts of the application have changed. Jib then intelligently rebuilds and pushes only those modified layers, while reusing the existing layers that remain unchanged.

To enable incremental builds with Jib, you need to configure it properly in your project's build file. Here's an example using Gradle:

```java
plugins {
    id 'com.google.cloud.tools.jib' version 'X.X.X'
}

jib {
    container {
        useOnlyProjectCache = true
        skipBuildahCommand = true
    }
}
```

In this example, `useOnlyProjectCache` is set to `true`, which tells Jib to only use the local project's cache during the container build. This avoids downloading any base images that have not changed since the last build.

Another configuration option, `skipBuildahCommand`, is set to `true` to improve build time on Linux by skipping the use of the `buildah` command, which is not necessary for incremental builds.

By enabling these options, Jib will intelligently track the changes in your Java application code and dependencies, resulting in significantly faster build times for subsequent container builds. This is especially beneficial in CI/CD pipelines where speed and efficiency are crucial.

In conclusion, Jib's support for incremental Java container builds is a game-changer for developers working with large Java applications. It allows for faster build times by intelligently determining which parts of the application have changed and only rebuilding those portions. This feature greatly enhances productivity and makes the containerization process more efficient. Give Jib a try in your next Java project and experience the benefits of incremental builds firsthand!
