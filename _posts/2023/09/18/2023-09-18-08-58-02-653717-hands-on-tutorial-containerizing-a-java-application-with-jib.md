In this hands-on tutorial, we will explore containerizing a Java application using Jib, a powerful containerization tool that simplifies the container build process. Jib abstracts away the complexity of Dockerfiles and container registries, making it easier for developers to package and distribute their Java applications.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Apache Maven or Gradle build tool installed
- Docker installed on your machine

## Step 1: Setting up the Java Application
To demonstrate containerization with Jib, let's create a simple Java application. Create a new directory, navigate inside it, and run the following commands:

```java
# Create a new Java class
mkdir src/main/java/com/example/myapp
echo 'public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Containerized World!");
    }
}' > src/main/java/com/example/myapp/App.java

# Create a Maven project
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.myapp -DartifactId=myapp -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

This will create a new Java class called `App` inside the `com.example.myapp` package and initialize a Maven project structure.

## Step 2: Adding Jib to the Project
Next, let's add Jib to our project's build configuration. Open the `pom.xml` file in the root of your project and add the following plugin configuration inside the `<build>` section:

```xml
<plugins>
    <!-- ...other plugins... -->

    <plugin>
        <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>jib-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.0</version>
        <configuration>
            <to>
                <image>myapp:latest</image>
            </to>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```

This configuration sets the target image name to `myapp:latest`.

## Step 3: Building and Containerizing with Jib
With Jib configured in our project, we can now build and containerize our Java application. Run the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean package jib:dockerBuild
```

This command will build the application, create a Docker image, and push it to your local Docker registry. Jib automatically handles all the necessary steps, including building a container image with the application dependencies.

## Step 4: Running the Containerized Java Application
To run the containerized Java application, simply execute the following Docker command:

```bash
docker run myapp:latest
```

You should see the output: `Hello, Containerized World!`.

Congratulations! You have successfully containerized a Java application using Jib. Containerization simplifies deployment and ensures that your applications run consistently across different environments.

## Conclusion
Containerization has become an integral part of modern software development. With tools like Jib, containerizing Java applications has become simpler than ever before. By following this hands-on tutorial, you have learned how to containerize a Java application using Jib, enabling you to easily package and distribute your applications with ease.
