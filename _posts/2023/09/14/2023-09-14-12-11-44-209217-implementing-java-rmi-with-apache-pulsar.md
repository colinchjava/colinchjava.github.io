Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a mechanism that allows Java objects to invoke methods on remote objects in a distributed system. Apache Pulsar is a distributed messaging and streaming platform that provides scalable and reliable messaging capabilities. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate Java RMI with Apache Pulsar to achieve distributed method invocation.

## What is Java RMI?

Java RMI is a Java API that allows objects in one Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to invoke methods on objects in another JVM, either on the same machine or over a network. It provides a transparent, remote method invocation facility that supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication between Java objects.

## What is Apache Pulsar?

Apache Pulsar is an open-source distributed messaging and streaming platform that provides a unified messaging model and durable storage for message streams. It offers high throughput, low latency, and scalability, making it suitable for building event-driven architectures and real-time analytics applications.

## Integrating Java RMI with Apache Pulsar

To integrate Java RMI with Apache Pulsar, we need to establish a communication channel between the RMI client and server using Pulsar as the messaging system. Here are the steps to implement it:

1. Set up Apache Pulsar: Install and configure Apache Pulsar on your local machine or cluster. You can follow the official documentation for detailed instructions.

2. Define RMI interfaces: Create the interfaces that define the methods you want to invoke remotely. Annotate the interfaces with `@Remote` to indicate that they are remote interfaces.

```java
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public interface RemoteCalculator extends Remote {
    int add(int x, int y) throws RemoteException;
}
```

3. Implement server class: Implement the server class that instantiates the remote object and binds it to a Pulsar topic. The server class should extend `UnicastRemoteObject` and implement the remote interface.

```java
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class RemoteCalculatorServer extends UnicastRemoteObject implements RemoteCalculator {
    public RemoteCalculatorServer() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }

    @Override
    public int add(int x, int y) throws RemoteException {
        return x + y;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate the server and bind it to a Pulsar topic
        try {
            RemoteCalculatorServer server = new RemoteCalculatorServer();
            // Bind the server object to a Pulsar topic
            // Publish method calls on the topic for the client to consume
            // ...
        } catch (RemoteException e) {
            // Handle exception
        }
    }
}
```

4. Implement client class: Implement the RMI client class that creates a Pulsar consumer and subscribes to the topic where the server publishes method calls. When a message is received, invoke the corresponding method on the remote object.

```java
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class RemoteCalculatorClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Locate the RMI registry
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry("localhost", 1099);

            // Retrieve the remote object from the registry
            RemoteCalculator calculator = (RemoteCalculator) registry.lookup("calculator");

            // Invoke remote method
            int result = calculator.add(5, 3);
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle exception
        }
    }
}
```

5. Run the application: Start the server class and then run the client class. The client will invoke the remote method on the server and display the result.

## Conclusion

Integrating Java RMI with Apache Pulsar enables distributed method invocation with reliable messaging capabilities. This combination allows you to build scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems that can invoke methods across different JVMs. By leveraging the power of Java RMI and Apache Pulsar, you can achieve efficient and robust communication between components in your distributed application.
