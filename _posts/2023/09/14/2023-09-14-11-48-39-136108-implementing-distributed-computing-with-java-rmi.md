Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a powerful technology that allows developers to build distributed computing systems in Java. It enables objects in one JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to invoke methods on objects located in another JVM, even if they are running on different physical machines. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement distributed computing using Java RMI.

## Overview of Java RMI

Java RMI provides a way to create distributed applications by allowing remote objects to be invoked as if they were local objects. The communication between the client and server happens through remote method calls. Java RMI handles the serialization and deserialization of parameters and return values transparently, making it easy for developers to build distributed systems.

## Creating a Remote Interface

To start with Java RMI, you need to define a remote interface that declares the methods to be invoked remotely. Remote interfaces extend the `java.rmi.Remote` interface and each method needs to throw a `java.rmi.RemoteException`.

```java
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public interface MyRemoteInterface extends Remote {
    String sayHello() throws RemoteException;
}
```

## Implementing the Remote Interface

After defining the remote interface, you need to create a class that implements it. The implementation class should extend `java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject` to make the remote object available for remote method invocations.

```java
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class MyRemoteImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteInterface {
    
    public MyRemoteImpl() throws RemoteException {
        // Constructor needs to throw RemoteException
    }

    @Override
    public String sayHello() throws RemoteException {
        return "Hello, distributed world!";
    }
}
```

## Setting up the Server

To set up the server, you need to create a Java RMI registry that listens for incoming remote method invocations. You also need to bind the remote object to a name in the registry so that clients can look it up and invoke its methods.

```java
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class Server {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            MyRemoteInterface remoteObject = new MyRemoteImpl();
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099); // Default port is 1099
            registry.rebind("myRemoteObject", remoteObject);
            System.out.println("Server is running...");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementing the Client

To make remote method invocations from a client, you need to obtain a reference to the remote object from the RMI registry and then invoke its methods as if it were a local object.

```java
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry("localhost", 1099); // Connect to the registry
            MyRemoteInterface remoteObject = (MyRemoteInterface) registry.lookup("myRemoteObject");
            String message = remoteObject.sayHello();
            System.out.println(message);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Java RMI provides a convenient way to build distributed computing systems in Java. It allows objects in different JVMs to communicate through remote method invocations seamlessly. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily implement distributed computing using Java RMI.
