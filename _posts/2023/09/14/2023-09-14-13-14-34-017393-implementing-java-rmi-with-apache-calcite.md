## What is Java RMI?

Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is a Java API used to perform remote method invocations, allowing objects located in different JVMs to interact with each other. It enables developers to create distributed applications by providing a simple way to call methods on remote objects.

## Apache Calcite and Remote Method Invocation

Apache Calcite provides various capabilities for query parsing, optimization, planning, and execution. By combining these features with Java RMI, we can create a distributed query processing system.

To implement Java RMI with Apache Calcite, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define the Remote Interface

First, we need to define a remote interface that will be used for method invocation. This interface should extend the `java.rmi.Remote` interface and declare the methods we want to invoke remotely. For example:

```java
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public interface RemoteCalculator extends Remote {
    double add(double a, double b) throws RemoteException;
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the Remote Object

Next, we need to implement the remote object that will provide the actual implementation for the methods declared in the remote interface. This object should extend `java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject` and implement the remote interface. For example:

```java
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class CalculatorImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements RemoteCalculator {
    public CalculatorImpl() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }

    @Override
    public double add(double a, double b) throws RemoteException {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create the RMI Server

We need to create an RMI server that will bind the remote object to a specific name in the RMI registry. This server will handle the requests from RMI clients. For example:

```java
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public class CalculatorServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            RemoteCalculator calculator = new CalculatorImpl();

            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
            registry.bind("Calculator", calculator);

            System.out.println("RMI server started.");
        } catch (RemoteException | java.rmi.AlreadyBoundException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Create the RMI Client

Finally, we need to create an RMI client that will connect to the RMI server and invoke the methods on the remote object. For example:

```java
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public class CalculatorClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry("localhost", 1099);
            Remote remoteObject = registry.lookup("Calculator");
            RemoteCalculator calculator = (RemoteCalculator) remoteObject;

            double result = calculator.add(5.0, 3.0);
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

By combining the power of Java RMI and Apache Calcite, we can build distributed query processing systems that provide efficient remote method invocations. Apache Calcite's query optimization capabilities can enhance the performance of these distributed systems, making them ideal for big data and distributed computing scenarios.
