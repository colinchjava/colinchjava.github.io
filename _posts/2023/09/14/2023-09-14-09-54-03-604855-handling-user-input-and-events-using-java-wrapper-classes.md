User input and event handling are essential aspects of many Java applications. Whether you're building a desktop application or a web-based system, handling user interactions is crucial. In this blog post, we'll explore how to handle user input and events using Java wrapper classes.

## What are Java Wrapper Classes?

Java provides a set of wrapper classes that encapsulate primitive data types and provide additional functionality. These wrapper classes allow us to work with primitive types, such as `int`, `double`, `boolean`, etc., as objects. They also offer useful methods for converting and manipulating these values.

## Handling User Input with Scanner

To handle user input, we can use the `Scanner` class, which is part of the `java.util` package. This class provides various methods to read different types of values from the user, such as integers, doubles, strings, and more.

Here's an example of how to use the `Scanner` class to read user input for an integer:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("You entered: " + number);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
In the above example, we first create an instance of the `Scanner` class, passing `System.in` as the input source, which represents the standard input. We then use the `nextInt()` method to read an integer value from the user. Finally, we print the retrieved value.

## Handling Events with ActionListener

In Java GUI applications, we often need to handle user events, such as button clicks or menu selections. The `ActionListener` interface, present in the `java.awt.event` package, provides a way to listen for and respond to such events.

Consider the following example, where we handle a button click event using the `ActionListener` interface:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class ButtonClickExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Frame frame = new Frame("Button Click Example");
        Button button = new Button("Click Me");

        button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                System.out.println("Button clicked!");
            }
        });

        frame.add(button);
        frame.setSize(300, 200);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple GUI application with a frame and a button. We associate an instance of an anonymous inner class implementing the `ActionListener` interface with the button's `addActionListener` method. When the button is clicked, the `actionPerformed` method is invoked, and the message "Button clicked!" is printed to the console.

## Conclusion

Handling user input and events is a fundamental part of many Java applications. By leveraging Java wrapper classes such as `Scanner` for user input and implementing `ActionListener` to handle events, we can create interactive and responsive applications. Understanding these concepts allows us to build robust and user-friendly Java programs.
