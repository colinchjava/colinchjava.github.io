IceFaces provides built-in validation and conversion features to handle this task effortlessly. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement validation and data conversion using IceFaces.

## Validation

IceFaces provides a set of pre-defined validators that can be used to validate user input. These validators are available in the `com.icesoft.faces.validator` package and cover a wide range of data types and validation rules.

To apply validation to an input component in IceFaces, you need to associate a validator with it. Let's consider an example where we want to validate the input of a text field component for a numeric value:

```java
<ice:inputText id="numericInput" value="#{myBean.numericValue}">
  <f:validateDoubleRange minimum="0" maximum="100" />
</ice:inputText>
```

In the above code snippet, we have applied the `validateDoubleRange` validator to the `numericInput` component. This validator ensures that the value entered is a valid double within the specified range.

IceFaces also allows you to create your custom validators by implementing the `Validator` interface. This gives you the flexibility to define custom validation rules based on your application's requirements.

## Data Conversion

Apart from validation, IceFaces also provides data conversion capabilities to convert user input data from its string representation to the required data type.

Let's say we have an input component for a date field, and we want to convert the user-entered date string into a `java.util.Date` object:

```java
<ice:inputDate id="dateInput" value="#{myBean.dateValue}">
  <f:convertDateTime pattern="dd/MM/yyyy" />
</ice:inputDate>
```

In the above code snippet, we have used the `convertDateTime` converter to convert the user-entered date string to a `Date` object using the specified date format pattern.

Similarly, you can use various built-in converters provided by IceFaces, such as `convertNumber`, `convertBoolean`, etc., to convert user input data to the desired data type.

Just like validators, you can also create your custom converters by implementing the `Converter` interface. This allows you to define custom data conversion logic as per your application's requirements.

## Conclusion

IceFaces makes it easy to implement validation and data conversion in your web applications. Its built-in validators and converters provide a wide range of functionality to ensure the correctness and consistency of user input data.

By leveraging these features, you can streamline the validation and conversion process, resulting in a more robust and user-friendly web application.
