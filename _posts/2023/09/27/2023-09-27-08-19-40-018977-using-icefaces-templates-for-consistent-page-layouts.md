When developing web applications, it is important to have consistent page layouts to provide a seamless user experience. IceFaces, a JavaServer Faces (JSF) component framework, offers a powerful feature called templates that allows you to define a common layout for your application.

Templates in IceFaces provide a way to define a base layout with static content and placeholders for dynamic content. This enables you to reuse the common elements of your application across multiple pages, ensuring consistent branding, navigation, and overall design.

## Defining a Template

To start using templates in IceFaces, you need to define a template file that serves as the base layout for your application. This file typically includes the HTML structure, CSS stylesheets, and JSF components that you want to be consistent across all pages.

Here's an example of a simple IceFaces template:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
      xmlns:ice="http://www.icesoft.com/icefaces/component">
<head>
    <title>My Application</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"/>
</head>
<body>
    <ice:panelGroup styleClass="header">
        <h1>My Application Header</h1>
    </ice:panelGroup>
    
    <ice:panelGroup styleClass="content">
        <ui:insert name="content"/>
    </ice:panelGroup>
    
    <ice:panelGroup styleClass="footer">
        <p>Â© 2021 My Application. All rights reserved.</p>
    </ice:panelGroup>
</body>
</html>
```

In the above example, the `<ui:insert name="content"/>` tag acts as a placeholder where the dynamic content of each page will be inserted. The `styleClass` attribute sets CSS classes for styling purposes.

## Implementing Page-specific Content

To create a page that uses the defined template, you need to extend the template file and insert the specific content for that page. This is done by using the `ui:define` tag in the content area of the template.

Here's an example of a page that extends the template:

```xml
<ui:composition template="/templates/layout.xhtml"
                xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets">
    <ui:define name="content">
        <h2>Welcome to My Application!</h2>
        <p>This is the home page of the application.</p>
        ...
        <!-- page-specific content goes here -->
    </ui:define>
</ui:composition>
```

In this example, the `<ui:composition>` tag specifies the template file to use with the `template` attribute. The `ui:define` tag within the composition defines the content specific to that page. All page-specific content will be displayed within the `ui:insert` placeholder in the template.

## Benefits of Using Templates

By using IceFaces templates, you can achieve consistent page layouts throughout your application in a simpler and more efficient way. Here are some key benefits:

- **Code reusability**: Templates allow you to reuse common elements across multiple pages, reducing code duplication.
- **Consistent branding**: With a template, you can define a consistent branding for your application, including logos, headers, footers, and navigation elements.
- **Ease of maintenance**: If you need to make changes to the layout, you only need to update the template file, and the changes will be reflected across all pages that use that template.
- **Improved developer productivity**: Templates provide a defined structure and organization, making it easier for developers to focus on the specific content of each page.

In conclusion, using IceFaces templates for consistent page layouts in your web application not only provides a better user experience but also enhances code reusability and ease of maintenance. Consider leveraging this powerful feature to achieve a professional and cohesive design for your application.
