IceFaces is a powerful Java-based framework for creating interactive web applications. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps of creating a basic IceFaces application to get you started.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
- IceFaces library downloaded and added to your project

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

1. Open your IDE and create a new Java project.
2. Add the IceFaces library to your project by including the required JAR files.
3. Set up a web.xml file in the web/WEB-INF directory with the necessary configurations for your application.

## Step 2: Create a JSF Page

1. Create a new JSF page (e.g., index.xhtml) in the web directory.
2. Include the IceFaces namespace at the beginning of your file:

```xml
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
      xmlns:ice="http://www.icesoft.com/icefaces/component">
```

3. Add the IceFaces components you want to use within the `<ice:form>` tag:

```xml
<ice:form>
    <h:outputText value="Hello, IceFaces!" />
</ice:form>
```

## Step 3: Run the Application

1. Configure your IDE to run the web application on a local server (e.g., Apache Tomcat or GlassFish).
2. Start the local server and deploy your application.
3. Open a web browser and enter the URL of your application (e.g., http://localhost:8080/myapp/index.xhtml).
4. You should see the "Hello, IceFaces!" message rendered on the page.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've walked through the basic steps of creating a simple IceFaces application. You should now have a working understanding of how to set up a project, create a JSF page, and run the application.
