In this blog post, we will explore how to implement real-time collaboration features in IceFaces applications using a combination of WebSockets and IcePush.

## Setting up the project

Before we begin, make sure you have a basic IceFaces project set up and configured. If you're new to IceFaces, you can follow the official documentation to get started.

## Integrating WebSockets

WebSockets provide a bidirectional communication channel between the client and the server, allowing for real-time data transfer. IceFaces supports WebSockets out of the box, making it easy to integrate them into your application.

To enable WebSockets in your IceFaces application, you'll need to add the following configuration to your web.xml file:

```xml
<context-param>
    <param-name>org.icepush.autoSubscribe</param-name>
    <param-value>true</param-value>
</context-param>

<filter>
    <filter-name>icepush</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.icepush.servlet.ICEpushServlet</filter-class>
</filter>

<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>icepush</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/icepush/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```

This configuration tells IceFaces to automatically subscribe clients to push channels, which are used for real-time updates. It also registers the ICEpushServlet filter, which handles the WebSocket connections.

## Implementing real-time collaboration

Once WebSockets are set up, you can start implementing real-time collaboration features in your IceFaces application. Here are the general steps involved:

1. **Creating a push group**: A push group represents a collaborative session where multiple users can work together. You can create a push group for each document or project that requires real-time collaboration.

   ```java
   PushConfiguration pushConfiguration = PushContextFactory.getDefault().getPushConfiguration();
   pushConfiguration.setPushGroup(<pushGroupId>);
   ```

2. **Sending updates**: When a user makes changes to the document, you'll need to send the updates to other users in the push group. IceFaces provides the `PushContext` class for sending messages to specific push groups or individual clients.

   ```java
   PushContext pushContext = PushContextFactory.getDefault().getPushContext();
   pushContext.push(<pushGroupId>, <update>);
   ```

3. **Receiving updates**: On the client-side, you'll need to listen for incoming updates and apply them to the document. IceFaces provides the `<ice:socket>` component for handling WebSocket messages.

   ```html
   <ice:socket channel="<pushGroupId>" onmessage="handleUpdate(event)" />
   ```

   ```javascript
   function handleUpdate(event) {
       var update = event.data;
       // Applied the update to the document
   }
   ```

With these steps in place, users of your IceFaces application can collaborate in real-time, seeing each other's changes as they happen.

## Conclusion

Real-time collaboration can greatly enhance the user experience of IceFaces applications. By integrating WebSockets and IcePush, developers can easily implement real-time collaboration features such as shared editing or chat functionality. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you'll be able to enable real-time collaboration in your IceFaces applications and provide users with a more interactive and engaging experience.
