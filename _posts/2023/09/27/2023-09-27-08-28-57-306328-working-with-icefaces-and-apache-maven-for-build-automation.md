IceFaces is a popular Java-based framework for creating web applications with a rich user interface. Apache Maven, on the other hand, is a widely used build automation tool that simplifies the configuration and management of Java projects. Combining IceFaces with Apache Maven can streamline the development and deployment process of your web applications. In this blog post, we will guide you through the steps of setting up and working with IceFaces and Apache Maven for efficient build automation.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the details, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
2. Apache Maven installed and properly configured.

## Setting up a Maven Project with IceFaces

To get started, create a new Maven project by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```shell
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-icefaces-project -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
```
{: lang=shell}

This command generates a simple Maven project structure with the necessary files and directories. `-DgroupId` specifies the package name for your project, `-DartifactId` is the name of your project, and `-DarchetypeArtifactId` selects the appropriate archetype for creating a web application.

Once the project structure is created, navigate to the newly generated project directory:

```shell
cd my-icefaces-project
```
{: lang=shell}

In the `pom.xml` file, add the following dependency to include IceFaces in your project:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.icefaces</groupId>
    <artifactId>icefaces</artifactId>
    <version>4.3.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
{: lang=xml}

Save the changes and build your project using the following Maven command:

```shell
mvn clean package
```
{: lang=shell}

This command compiles your code, resolves the dependencies, and creates a deployable WAR file.

## Creating an IceFaces Web Application

Now that your Maven project is set up, it's time to create an IceFaces web application. Start by creating a new Java class that extends the `javax.faces.bean.ManagedBean` class:

```java
import javax.faces.bean.ManagedBean;

@ManagedBean
public class ExampleBean {
    private String message = "Hello IceFaces!";

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }
}
```
{: lang=java}

This class represents the backing bean for your web application and contains a `message` property with a default value.

Next, create a Facelets XHTML file, typically located in the `webapp` directory. Name it `example.xhtml` and add the following code:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html">
<h:head>
    <title>IceFaces Example</title>
</h:head>
<h:body>
    <h:outputText value="#{exampleBean.message}"/>
</h:body>
</html>
```
{: lang=xml}

This code represents the view part of your IceFaces application. It uses the `exampleBean` property to display the `message` value.

## Deploying and Running the Application

To deploy and run your application, execute the following Maven command:

```shell
mvn clean install icesoft:exploded-deploy
```
{: lang=shell}

This command builds and deploys your project to a local server. You can then access your IceFaces application through a web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/my-icefaces-project/example.xhtml`.

## Conclusion

By integrating IceFaces with Apache Maven, you can simplify the build and deployment process of your web applications. Apache Maven ensures consistent and reliable builds, while IceFaces provides a powerful framework for building responsive and interactive user interfaces. With the steps outlined in this blog post, you can start automating your IceFaces projects using Apache Maven right away.
