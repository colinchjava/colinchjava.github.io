1. **IceFaces Input Components**:
IceFaces provides a variety of input components for capturing user input. These include text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and select menus. For example, the `ice:inputText` component can be used to create a text input field:

```java
<ice:inputText id="username" value="#{bean.username}" />
```

Here, the `id` attribute uniquely identifies the component, and the `value` attribute binds the input to a backing bean property.

2. **IceFaces Output Components**:
IceFaces also offers several output components for displaying information to the user. These include labels, tables, panels, and much more. For instance, the `ice:outputLabel` component can be used to display text:

```java
<ice:outputLabel value="Welcome, #{bean.username}" />
```

This will display a label with the text "Welcome", followed by the value of the `username` property from the backing bean.

3. **IceFaces Command Components**:
IceFaces includes command components that allow users to perform actions, such as buttons and links. The `ice:commandButton` component can be used to trigger an action when clicked:

```java
<ice:commandButton value="Submit" action="#{bean.submitForm}" />
```

Here, the `value` attribute sets the text displayed on the button, and the `action` attribute specifies the method to be executed when the button is clicked.

4. **IceFaces Panel Components**:
IceFaces provides panel components that act as containers to group other components. For example, the `ice:panelGrid` component can be used to arrange components in a grid layout:

```java
<ice:panelGrid columns="2">
    <ice:outputLabel value="First Name:" />
    <ice:inputText id="firstName" value="#{bean.firstName}" />
    <ice:outputLabel value="Last Name:" />
    <ice:inputText id="lastName" value="#{bean.lastName}" />
</ice:panelGrid>
```

In this example, the `panelGrid` component creates a two-column grid to display labels and input fields for first and last names.

These are just a few examples of the many components provided by IceFaces. By using these components effectively, you can create interactive and engaging user interfaces in your Java web applications.
