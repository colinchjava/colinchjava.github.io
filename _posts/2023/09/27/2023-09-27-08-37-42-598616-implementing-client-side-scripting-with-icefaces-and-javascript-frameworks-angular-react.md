Client-side scripting allows us to enhance the functionality and interactivity of our web applications by running scripts directly on the client's browser. IceFaces, a popular JavaServer Faces (JSF) framework, provides seamless integration with JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and React, enabling developers to build robust and dynamic user interfaces.

In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage IceFaces along with Angular and React to create powerful client-side scripting capabilities in our web applications.

## IceFaces with Angular

Angular is a widely-used JavaScript framework for building web applications. To integrate IceFaces with Angular, we need to follow a few simple steps:

1. **Install IceFaces**: Begin by adding IceFaces to your existing Angular project. You can install it using npm:

   ```
   npm install icefaces-ngx
   ```

2. **Import and configure IceFaces**: Import the necessary IceFaces modules in your Angular project's `app.module.ts` file, and add them to the `imports` array:

   ```typescript
   import {IceModule} from 'icefaces-ngx';
   import {BrowserAnimationsModule} from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

   @NgModule({
     imports: [
       BrowserModule,
       BrowserAnimationsModule,
       IceModule
     ],
     // ...
   })
   export class AppModule { }
   ```

3. **Use IceFaces components**: IceFaces provides a set of custom components that can be used in your Angular templates. Import the necessary components and start using them in your project:

   ```typescript
   import {Component} from '@angular/core';
   import {IceInputText} from 'icefaces-ngx';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-example',
     template: `
       <ice-input-text [(ngModel)]="value"></ice-input-text>
       <button (click)="submit()">Submit</button>
     `
   })
   export class ExampleComponent {
     value: string;

     submit() {
       console.log('Submitted value:', this.value);
     }
   }
   ```

With these simple steps, you can seamlessly integrate IceFaces with your Angular project and take advantage of its rich set of components and features for client-side scripting.

## IceFaces with React

React is another popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Integrating IceFaces with React is also straightforward:

1. **Install IceFaces**: Begin by adding IceFaces to your existing React project. You can install it using npm:

   ```
   npm install icefaces4
   ```

2. **Import and configure IceFaces**: Import the necessary IceFaces modules in your React project's `index.js` file, and register them with the Ice.Integration object:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import IceFaces from 'icefaces4';

   Ice.Integration.configure({
     react: React,
     reactDOM: ReactDOM
   });

   ReactDOM.render(
     // ...
   );
   ```

3. **Use IceFaces components**: IceFaces provides a set of custom components that can be used in your React components. Import the necessary components and start using them in your project:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import {IceInputText} from 'icefaces4';

   class ExampleComponent extends React.Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.state = { value: '' };
     }

     submit() {
       console.log('Submitted value:', this.state.value);
     }

     render() {
       return (
         <div>
           <IceInputText value={this.state.value} onChange={(e) => this.setState({ value: e.target.value })} />
           <button onClick={() => this.submit()}>Submit</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate IceFaces with your React project and leverage its powerful components and features for enhanced client-side scripting.

## Conclusion

IceFaces provides seamless integration with popular JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and React, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can harness the power of IceFaces alongside Angular and React, and elevate the user experience of your web applications.
