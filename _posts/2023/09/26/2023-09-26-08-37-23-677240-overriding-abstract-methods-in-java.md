In object-oriented programming, an abstract method is a method that is declared in an abstract class or interface but does not have any implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class or implementers of the interface are required to provide an implementation for the abstract method.

To override an abstract method in Java, follow these steps:

1. Create a subclass that extends the abstract class or implements the interface which defines the abstract method.

    ```java
    public class MyClass extends AbstractClass {
        // Class implementation
    }
    ```

2. In the subclass, provide an implementation for the abstract method using the `@Override` annotation.

    ```java
    public class MyClass extends AbstractClass {
        @Override
        public void abstractMethod() {
            // Method implementation
        }
    }
    ```

3. The overridden method should have the same method signature (name, return type, and parameters) as the abstract method it is overriding.

    ```java
    public class MyClass extends AbstractClass {
        @Override
        public void abstractMethod() {
            // Method implementation
        }
    }
    ```

4. It is important to note that if a subclass is also abstract, it is not required to provide an implementation for the abstract method. It can be left to be implemented by further subclasses.

By following the above steps, you can successfully override an abstract method in Java.

# Conclusion
Overriding abstract methods in Java allows subclasses to provide their own implementation, making the code more flexible and customizable. Using the `@Override` annotation ensures that the method is actually overriding an abstract method in the parent class or interface. This feature is fundamental to the concept of polymorphism and abstraction in Java programming.
