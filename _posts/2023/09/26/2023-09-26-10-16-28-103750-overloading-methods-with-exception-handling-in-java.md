When working with Java, it is common to encounter situations where you need to handle exceptions in your code. Java provides a built-in mechanism for handling exceptions using try-catch blocks. However, when you have multiple methods performing similar tasks but potentially throwing different exceptions, it can be tedious to write separate exception handling logic for each method.

To address this, Java allows you to overload methods with different exception signatures. This means that you can have multiple methods with the same name but different sets of exceptions that they handle. This not only helps in organizing your code but also promotes code reusability.

Here's an example to demonstrate how to overload methods with exception handling in Java:

```java
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {

    public void divide(int x, int y) throws ArithmeticException {
        int result = 0;
        try {
            result = x / y;
        } catch(ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero");
        }
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }

    public void readFromArray(int[] arr, int index) throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException {
        try {
            int value = arr[index];
            System.out.println("Value at index " + index + ": " + value);
        } catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Invalid index");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExceptionHandlingExample example = new ExceptionHandlingExample();
        example.divide(10, 0);
        example.divide(15, 3);

        int[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        example.readFromArray(array, 3);
        example.readFromArray(array, 7);
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a class `ExceptionHandlingExample` with two overloaded methods - `divide` and `readFromArray`. The `divide` method handles the `ArithmeticException` thrown when dividing by zero, while the `readFromArray` handles the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when accessing an invalid index in an array.

As you can see, by overloading the methods with different exception signatures, we can specify separate exception handling logic for each method. This allows us to encapsulate the exception handling code within the respective methods, making our code more readable and maintainable.

Remember to choose exception handling approach wisely, and consider using exceptions only for exceptional situations. Overusing exceptions can lead to performance issues and make your code harder to debug.
