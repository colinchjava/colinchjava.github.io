In Java, method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. This feature can be used to write cleaner and more organized code by providing different ways to perform a particular operation.

When overloading methods, you may encounter situations where each method implementation throws different exceptions. Although the name and parameter list can be the same, the thrown exceptions must be handled differently.

To overload methods with different exceptions thrown in Java, you need to follow these steps:

1. Define the original method that throws a specific exception. This will be the base method for overloading.
2. Implement the overloaded method with the same name and parameter list, but throw a different exception.
3. Handle the exceptions appropriately in both methods.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept:

```java
public class Example {

    public void performOperation() throws IOException {
        // Code to perform the operation that throws IOException
    }

    public void performOperation() throws SQLException {
        // Code to perform the operation that throws SQLException
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example example = new Example();

        try {
            example.performOperation();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle IOException
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Handle SQLException
        }
    }
} 
```

In the above example, we have a class named `Example` with two overloaded methods named `performOperation`. The first `performOperation` method throws an `IOException`, while the second `performOperation` method throws a `SQLException`. 

In the `main` method, we create an instance of `Example` and call the `performOperation` method. Within the `try-catch` block, we catch the appropriate exception and handle it accordingly.

By overloading methods with different exceptions thrown, we can provide more flexibility and granular error handling in our code. It allows us to handle different exceptions separately and take appropriate actions based on the specific exception encountered.

Remember to choose meaningful names for the methods and exceptions to improve code readability and maintainability.
