Lambda expressions in Java provide a concise way to express a behavior of a function or method. They can be used to represent functional interfaces, which are interfaces with a single abstract method. By using lambdas, we can achieve abstraction by separating the implementation details from the actual execution.

Here is an example of using abstraction with lambda expressions in Java:

```java
public class AbstractionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define a lambda expression to represent the behavior of adding two numbers
        MathOperation addition = (int a, int b) -> a + b;

        // Define a lambda expression to represent the behavior of subtracting two numbers
        MathOperation subtraction = (int a, int b) -> a - b;

        int firstNumber = 10;
        int secondNumber = 5;

        // Use the add operation
        int sum = operate(firstNumber, secondNumber, addition);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);

        // Use the subtract operation
        int difference = operate(firstNumber, secondNumber, subtraction);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + difference);
    }

    // Define a functional interface for the math operation
    interface MathOperation {
        int operation(int a, int b);
    }

    // Method that takes a lambda expression as a parameter
    static int operate(int a, int b, MathOperation mathOperation) {
        return mathOperation.operation(a, b);
    }
}
```

In the example above, we define a `MathOperation` functional interface with a single abstract method `operation(int a, int b)`. We then define two lambda expressions to represent the behavior of adding and subtracting two numbers. Finally, we pass these lambda expressions as parameters to the `operate` method, which performs the desired mathematical operation.

By using lambda expressions, we can achieve a higher level of abstraction by focusing on the behavior of functions rather than their implementation details. This makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.
