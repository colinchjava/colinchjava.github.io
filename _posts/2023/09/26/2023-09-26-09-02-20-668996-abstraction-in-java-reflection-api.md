In Java, **reflection** is a powerful feature that allows the program to examine and modify its own structure at runtime. The Java Reflection API provides a set of classes and methods that enables us to dynamically inspect and manipulate classes, interfaces, fields, methods, and constructors. 

One of the key concepts in the Java Reflection API is **abstraction**. Abstraction, in the context of reflection, refers to the ability to treat objects of different classes uniformly based on their common characteristics. This allows us to write generic code that can work with a wide range of class instances without depending on their specific types.

Abstraction in the Java Reflection API is achieved through the use of the `java.lang.reflect` package, which provides classes such as `Class`, `Field`, `Method`, `Constructor`, and `Parameter`. These classes allow us to obtain information about the structure and behavior of a class at runtime.

Here's an example that demonstrates abstraction in the Java Reflection API:

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class ReflectionDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Class<?> clazz = Class.forName("com.example.MyClass"); // Load class dynamically
        
        Method method = clazz.getDeclaredMethod("myMethod"); // Get method using reflection
        
        // Invoke the method on an instance of the class
        Object obj = clazz.newInstance();
        method.invoke(obj);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we use the `Class.forName()` method to dynamically load the class `com.example.MyClass`. Then, we use the `getDeclaredMethod()` method to obtain a reference to the `myMethod()` method defined in the class. Finally, we create an instance of the class using `newInstance()` and invoke the method on that instance using `invoke()`.

By utilizing the abstraction provided by the Java Reflection API, we're able to write generic code that can work with any class and invoke its methods dynamically. This flexibility allows for powerful runtime behavior and enables frameworks and libraries to implement advanced features such as dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.
