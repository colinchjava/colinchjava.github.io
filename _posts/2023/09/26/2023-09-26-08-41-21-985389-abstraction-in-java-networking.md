When working with networking in Java, one of the key concepts to understand is abstraction. Abstraction is the process of hiding the complexity of the underlying system and providing a simplified interface for interacting with it.

In the context of Java networking, abstraction allows us to work with high-level classes and methods without having to deal with the low-level details of network protocols and connections. This makes it easier to write network applications and promotes code reusability.

One of the fundamental abstractions in Java networking is the `Socket` class. A `Socket` represents a connection between two endpoints over a network. It provides methods for establishing and managing the connection, sending and receiving data, and closing the connection.

To illustrate the abstraction in Java networking, let's take a look at a simple client-server example.

## Client Code
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.Socket;

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);

            out.println("Hello, server!");

            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            String response = in.readLine();

            System.out.println("Server response: " + response);

            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Server Code
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

public class Server {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
            System.out.println("Server started and waiting for client connections...");

            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
            String request = in.readLine();

            System.out.println("Received request from client: " + request);

            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
            out.println("Hello, client!");

            clientSocket.close();
            serverSocket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the client code establishes a connection to a server running on `localhost` at port `8080`. It sends a "Hello, server!" message and then receives the response from the server.

On the server side, the server code listens for client connections on port `8080`. When a client connects, it reads the client's request, prints it to the console, sends a "Hello, client!" response, and closes the connection.

Both the client and server code make use of the `Socket` class to abstract away the complexity of establishing and managing network connections. They can focus on the high-level logic of sending and receiving messages without having to deal with the intricacies of the underlying network protocol.

In conclusion, abstraction in Java networking simplifies the development of network applications by providing a high-level interface to interact with the underlying system. It allows developers to focus on the business logic of their applications without getting bogged down by low-level network details.
