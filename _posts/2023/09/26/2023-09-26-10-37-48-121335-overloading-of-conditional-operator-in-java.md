The conditional operator (also known as the ternary operator) in Java allows us to write a concise if-else statement in a single line of code. It has the following syntax:

```java
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

However, did you know that you can overload the conditional operator in Java, just like any other operator? It means you can define multiple versions of the conditional operator to work with different types of operands.

Let's take a look at an example:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public static int max(int a, int b) {
        return a > b ? a : b;
    }

    public static double max(double a, double b) {
        return a > b ? a : b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int resultInt = max(5, 10);
        double resultDouble = max(5.5, 10.5);

        System.out.println("Maximum integer value: " + resultInt);
        System.out.println("Maximum double value: " + resultDouble);
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have defined two versions of the `max` method â€“ one for comparing integers and another for comparing doubles. Both methods use the conditional operator internally to determine the maximum value.

When we call the `max` method with two integers or two doubles, the appropriate overloaded version is selected based on the argument types. The result is then printed to the console.

By overloading the conditional operator, we can add flexibility to our code and handle different types of comparisons efficiently.

## Conclusion

Overloading the conditional operator allows us to customize its behavior based on the types of operands we are working with. This feature enhances the flexibility and readability of our code.
