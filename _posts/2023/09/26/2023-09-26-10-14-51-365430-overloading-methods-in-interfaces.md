In object-oriented programming, **overloading** is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Overloading methods in interfaces provide a way to define multiple methods with the same name in an interface. This can be useful when different implementations of the same method are required based on different parameter types.

To demonstrate overloading methods in interfaces, let's consider the following example:

```java
interface Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b);
    float add(float a, float b);
    double add(double a, double b);
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `Calculator` interface declares three methods named `add()`. Each method has the same name but different parameter types. This allows for different implementations of the `add()` method based on the type of data being added.

Let's say we have a class that implements the `Calculator` interface and provides the actual implementation for the `add()` method:

```java
class BasicCalculator implements Calculator {
    @Override
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    @Override
    public float add(float a, float b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    @Override
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

The `BasicCalculator` class implements the `Calculator` interface and provides the required implementation for the `add()` method for different parameter types.

By overloading the `add()` method in the `Calculator` interface, we can have a single interface that supports adding integers, floats, and doubles. The implementation can vary based on the type of parameters.

To use the `BasicCalculator`, we can create an instance of the class and invoke the `add()` method with different parameters:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BasicCalculator calculator = new BasicCalculator();
        
        int sum1 = calculator.add(2, 3);
        System.out.println("Sum of integers: " + sum1);
        
        float sum2 = calculator.add(2.5f, 3.7f);
        System.out.println("Sum of floats: " + sum2);
        
        double sum3 = calculator.add(2.5, 3.7);
        System.out.println("Sum of doubles: " + sum3);
    }
}
```

The above code demonstrates how to use the `add()` method with different data types. Since we overloaded the `add()` method in the interface, the appropriate implementation is selected based on the parameter types.

In conclusion, overloading methods in interfaces allows for defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This feature provides flexibility in implementing methods for different data types while adhering to a common interface. Using overloading in interfaces can make the code more readable, maintainable, and extensible.
