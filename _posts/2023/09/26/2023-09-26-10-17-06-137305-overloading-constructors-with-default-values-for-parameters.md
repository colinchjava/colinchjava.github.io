In object-oriented programming, constructors are special methods used to initialize the state of an object. Constructors allow us to create instances of a class and set their initial values. 

In some cases, we might want to provide different ways to construct an object by allowing different combinations of parameters. Overloading constructors allows us to define multiple constructors for a class, each with a different set of parameters. 

One useful feature of constructor overloading is the ability to provide default values for parameters. Default values allow us to create objects using a constructor even if we don't provide values for all the parameters. 

Let's take a look at an example in Python:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, color="black"):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.color = color

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car: {self.make} {self.model} {self.year} {self.color}")

# Creating objects using different constructors
car1 = Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022)
car2 = Car("Tesla", "Model Y", 2021, "blue")

# Displaying information about the cars
car1.display_info()
car2.display_info()
```

In the example above, the `Car` class defines a constructor with four parameters: `make`, `model`, `year`, and `color`. The `color` parameter has a default value of "black". 

By providing a default value for `color`, we can create objects using either three or four parameters. If we only provide three parameters, the `color` parameter will default to "black". This allows us to have flexibility when creating instances of the `Car` class.

The output of the above program will be:
```
Car: Honda Civic 2022 black
Car: Tesla Model Y 2021 blue
```

By overloading constructors with default values for parameters, we can provide convenience and flexibility in object creation. It allows us to create objects with a varying number of parameters while providing sensible default values for those that are not explicitly specified.
