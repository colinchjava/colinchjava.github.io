In Java, method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters. This provides flexibility and enhances code readability. However, it is important to note that when overloading methods, the access level for overloaded methods can differ.

## Access Levels in Java

Java supports four access levels for class members: `private`, `default`, `protected`, and `public`. These access levels define the visibility and accessibility of variables, methods, and classes within a program.

- `private` members are only accessible within the same class.
- `default` (no explicit keyword) members are accessible within the same package.
- `protected` members are accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- `public` members are accessible from anywhere.

## Overloading Methods with Different Access Levels

When overloading methods, it is permissible to have different access levels for each method. In other words, you can have a private method, a protected method, and a public method with the same name, as long as the parameters differ.

Let's consider an example:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    protected double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    private String add(String a, String b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `Calculator` class with three overloaded `add` methods. The first method takes two integers and returns their sum, the second method takes two doubles and returns their sum, and the third method takes two strings and concatenates them.

The access levels for these methods are different:

- The public method is accessible from anywhere outside the class.
- The protected method is accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- The private method is only accessible within the same class.

## Conclusion

In Java, you can overload methods with different access levels. This allows you to provide different functionalities for methods with the same name, based on the parameters passed to them. However, it is important to consider the implications of different access levels and ensure that your methods are accessible as per your design requirements.
