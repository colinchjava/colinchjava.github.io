In object-oriented programming, abstraction is an essential concept that allows developers to hide complex implementation details and provide a simplified interface. Java, being an object-oriented language, relies heavily on abstraction to build modular and maintainable code. Here are some real-world examples of abstraction in Java:

## 1. File Input and Output Streams

In Java, the `java.io` package provides classes like `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` to read from and write to files. These classes hide the low-level details of handling file operations, such as opening and closing the file, byte-level reading or writing, and buffering. By using these classes, developers can abstract away the complexities of file handling and focus on the higher-level tasks, making code more readable and manageable.

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
     FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.txt")) {
    // Read from input file and write to output file
    int byteValue;
    while ((byteValue = fileInputStream.read()) != -1) {
        fileOutputStream.write(byteValue);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

## 2. Database Connectivity

When working with databases in Java, the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API provides a level of abstraction. It allows developers to interact with various database management systems without worrying about the underlying implementation details. The JDBC API provides interfaces like `Connection`, `Statement`, and `ResultSet`, which are implemented by database-specific drivers. Developers can write code that is independent of the database they are working with, thus achieving a high level of abstraction.

```java
try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb", "username", "password");
     Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
     ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM customers")) {
    // Process the result set
    while (resultSet.next()) {
        int customerId = resultSet.getInt("customer_id");
        String customerName = resultSet.getString("customer_name");
        // ...
    }
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

Abstraction in Java not only simplifies code implementation but also provides flexibility and modularity. By hiding implementation details, developers can focus on solving higher-level problems and build reusable and extensible software.
