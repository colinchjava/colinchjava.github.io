Lambda expressions in Java are a powerful feature introduced in Java 8 that allow us to write compact and efficient code. They enable us to pass behavior as a parameter to methods, similar to what we can achieve with anonymous inner classes.

One interesting aspect of lambda expressions is that they can be used to overload methods. Overloading is the ability to have multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameters. With lambda expressions, we can have different functional interfaces that match different signatures, allowing us to have overloaded methods.

Let's look at an example to understand how we can overload methods using lambda expressions in Java:

```java
public class OverloadingMethodsExample {

    interface MathOperation {
        int operate(int a, int b);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OverloadingMethodsExample example = new OverloadingMethodsExample();

        MathOperation addition = (a, b) -> a + b;
        MathOperation multiplication = (a, b) -> a * b;

        int sum = example.doOperation(addition, 5, 3);
        int product = example.doOperation(multiplication, 4, 2);

        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Output: Sum: 8
        System.out.println("Product: " + product); // Output: Product: 8
    }

    public int doOperation(MathOperation operation, int a, int b) {
        return operation.operate(a, b);
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have defined a functional interface `MathOperation` with a single method `operate` that takes two integers and returns an integer. We then create two lambda expressions `addition` and `multiplication`, each referencing this interface. These lambda expressions define the behavior of addition and multiplication, respectively.

We then utilize the `doOperation` method to perform the desired operation based on the lambda expression passed as an argument. This method is overloaded with different functional interface signatures, accepting different types of operations.

As you can see, by using lambda expressions and functional interfaces, we can achieve method overloading in Java, making our code more concise and expressive.
