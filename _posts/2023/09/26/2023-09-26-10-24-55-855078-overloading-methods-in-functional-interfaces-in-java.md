Java 8 introduced functional interfaces, which are interfaces that contain a single abstract method. The functional interface concept allows us to use lambda expressions or method references to create concise implementations of the interface's abstract method.

In some cases, we might want to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a functional interface. This is where overloading methods in functional interfaces becomes useful.

Let's consider a scenario where we have a functional interface called `Calculator`, which has a single abstract method `calculate`. Initially, this method only takes a single parameter:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int num);
}
```

We can implement this functional interface using a lambda expression:

```java
Calculator square = (num) -> num * num;
int result = square.calculate(5); // returns 25
```

Now, let's say we want to add another method to the `Calculator` functional interface that takes two parameters instead of one. We can achieve this by overloading the `calculate` method:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int num);
    
    int calculate(int num1, int num2);
}
```

Now, we can implement the overloaded `calculate` method:

```java
Calculator addition = (num1, num2) -> num1 + num2;
int result = addition.calculate(5, 3); // returns 8
```

By overloading the `calculate` method, we can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a functional interface. This allows for more flexibility in implementing the functional interface based on the specific requirements.

However, it's important to note that overloading methods in functional interfaces should be used judiciously to avoid confusion and ambiguity. It is recommended to clearly document the purpose and expected behavior of each overloaded method.
