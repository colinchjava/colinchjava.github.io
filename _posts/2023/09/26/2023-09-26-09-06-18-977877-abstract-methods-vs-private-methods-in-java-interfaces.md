Java interfaces provide a way to define a contract that classes can implement. They allow you to specify a set of methods that must be implemented by the classes that are implementing the interface. 

In addition to abstract methods, which are commonly used in interfaces, Java 9 introduced the ability to include private methods as well. Private methods in interfaces allow you to define helper methods that can be used internally by the interface itself or by default methods within the same interface. 

## Why use abstract methods in interfaces?

Abstract methods in interfaces define the core functionality that implementing classes must provide. These methods act as a contract, specifying what methods a class must have. When a class implements an interface, it must provide an implementation for all abstract methods defined in that interface. 

Using abstract methods in interfaces provides a way to enforce a common structure and behavior across multiple classes. It helps in achieving code reusability and promotes a clean separation of concerns.

For example, consider an interface `Shape` with the abstract method `calculateArea()`. Any class that implements the `Shape` interface must provide its own implementation of the `calculateArea()` method.

## What are private methods in interfaces?

Java 9 onwards, interfaces can also include private methods, which are not visible to implementing classes. These private methods serve as helper methods that can be used by other methods within the interface itself. 

The addition of private methods in interfaces helps in reducing code duplication and provides a way to encapsulate common functionality. It allows for better organization and maintainability of code within the interface.

Private methods can be used to break down complex methods into smaller, more manageable chunks. They can be used by the default methods within the same interface to implement common functionality.

## When to use abstract methods or private methods in interfaces?

Use abstract methods in interfaces when you want to define a required behavior that must be implemented by the classes that implement the interface. Abstract methods provide a way to enforce a contract between the interface and the implementing classes.

On the other hand, use private methods in interfaces when you want to encapsulate common functionality that can be used internally within the interface. Private methods are not visible to implementing classes but can be utilized by other methods within the same interface to implement shared logic.

## Conclusion

In Java interfaces, abstract methods define the required behavior that implementing classes must provide, while private methods provide a way to encapsulate and reuse common functionality within the interface. By using both abstract and private methods effectively, you can create clean and reusable code structures in your Java applications.
