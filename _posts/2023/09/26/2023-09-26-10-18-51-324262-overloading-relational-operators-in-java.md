In Java, **relational operators** are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. By default, Java provides a set of predefined relational operators such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=` to compare primitive data types like integers, floating-point numbers, and characters. However, when working with **custom data types**, you might need to redefine the behavior of these relational operators. This can be achieved through **operator overloading**.

Operator overloading allows you to define how an operator should behave when applied to objects of a class. By overloading the relational operators, you can create custom comparison logic tailored to your specific needs.

## Overloading Relational Operators

To overload the relational operators in Java, follow these steps:

1. Define a class that you want to compare.
2. Implement the `Comparable` interface, which provides a method called `compareTo()` for comparing objects of your class.

Here's an example of overloading the `<` and `>` operators for a `Person` class:

```java
public class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    // Constructor, getters, and setters
    
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Person other) {
        // Compare the age of two Person objects
        if (this.age < other.age) {
            return -1;
        } else if (this.age > other.age) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    
    // Rest of the class implementation
}
```

In the above example, we have implemented the `Comparable<Person>` interface and overridden the `compareTo()` method. Inside the `compareTo()` method, we compare the `age` of the current object (`this.age`) with the `age` of the `other` object.

The `compareTo()` method returns a negative value if `this.age < other.age`, a positive value if `this.age > other.age`, and 0 if `this.age` is equal to `other.age`. This custom comparison logic allows us to compare `Person` objects based on their ages.

## Usage of Overloaded Relational Operators

Once you have overloaded the relational operators, you can use them just like the predefined operators on objects of your class. Here's an example usage:

```java
Person john = new Person("John", 25);
Person jane = new Person("Jane", 30);

if (john.compareTo(jane) < 0) {
    System.out.println("John is younger than Jane");
} else if (john.compareTo(jane) > 0) {
    System.out.println("John is older than Jane");
} else {
    System.out.println("John and Jane are the same age");
}
```

In the above example, we compare the ages of two `Person` objects using the overloaded `<` (`compareTo()` returning a negative value) and `>` (`compareTo()` returning a positive value) operators.

By overloading the relational operators, you can add custom comparison logic to your classes, making them more expressive and flexible.
