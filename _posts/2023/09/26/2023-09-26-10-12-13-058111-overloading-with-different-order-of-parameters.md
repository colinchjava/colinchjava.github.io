In object-oriented programming, method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python does not support method overloading by default, but we can achieve similar functionality using default parameters and *args or **kwargs.

To create overloaded methods with different orders of parameters in Python, we can define a method with default parameter values and use recursion to handle different orderings.

## Example:

Let's say we want to create an `add_numbers` method that can accept two integers or three integers and return their sum.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b, c=None):
    if c is None:
        return a + b
    else:
        return a + b + c
```

In the above example, the `add_numbers` method takes three parameters, with the third parameter set to `None` by default. If the third parameter is `None`, we know that the method is called with only two parameters, and we can simply return the sum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, we know that the method is called with three parameters and we return the sum of all three.

## Usage:

```python
print(add_numbers(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add_numbers(2, 3, 4))  # Output: 9
```

In the above usage example, we can see that we can call the `add_numbers` method with either two or three parameters, and it will perform the addition accordingly.

## Conclusion:

Although Python does not support method overloading directly, we can achieve a similar effect by using default parameter values and conditional statements. By defining a method with default parameter values and handling different parameter combinations using conditionals, we can create overloaded methods with different orders of parameters in Python. This approach gives us more flexibility and allows for a clearer and more concise design of our code.
