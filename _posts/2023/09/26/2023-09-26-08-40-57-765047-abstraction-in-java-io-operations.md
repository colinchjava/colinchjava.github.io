Java provides a powerful I/O (Input/Output) API that allows developers to read and write data from various sources, such as files, network sockets, and user input. One key concept underlying the Java I/O operations is abstraction, which allows for flexibility and modularity in handling different I/O sources.

Abstraction in Java I/O is achieved through the use of classes and interfaces that provide a high-level representation of the underlying I/O resources. Let's explore some examples of abstraction in Java I/O operations.

### 1. InputStream and OutputStream

In the Java I/O API, the `InputStream` and `OutputStream` are abstract classes that serve as the foundation for reading and writing bytes of data. These classes provide a common interface to work with different types of input and output streams, such as file streams, network streams, and more. Developers can utilize these classes to perform I/O operations without having to worry about the specific details of the underlying data source.

Example code:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class IOTest {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try {
         InputStream input = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
         OutputStream output = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");

         int data;
         while ((data = input.read()) != -1) {
            output.write(data);
         }

         input.close();
         output.close();
      } catch (IOException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
```

### 2. BufferedReader and BufferedWriter

Another example of abstraction in Java I/O is the use of classes like `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` that provide buffering capabilities, improving I/O performance. These classes wrap around other input and output streams and add buffering functionality to efficiently read and write larger chunks of data at once.

Example code:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class BufferedIOTest {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try {
         BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt"));
         BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"));

         String line;
         while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            writer.write(line + "\n");
         }

         reader.close();
         writer.close();
      } catch (IOException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
```

In the above code, the `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` classes provide a higher-level abstraction by buffering the data read from the file, which can significantly improve performance when dealing with large files.

By utilizing these abstractions in the Java I/O API, developers can write more modular and reusable code that can seamlessly handle different I/O sources without requiring significant changes in the implementation.

Abstraction in Java I/O operations simplifies the development process and promotes code maintainability, making it easier to extend and modify I/O functionality in the future.
