In Java, **method overloading** allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This enables you to perform similar operations on different types of input.

When it comes to overloading methods, you may encounter scenarios where you want to use a combination of **varargs** and regular parameters. This allows you to pass in multiple arguments of variable length, while also specifying additional parameters.

Let's take a look at an example where we have a method that calculates the sum of an arbitrary number of integers, but can also accept an additional `String` parameter.

```java
public class Calculator {
  public static int sum(int... numbers) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int number : numbers) {
      total += number;
    }
    
    return total;
  }
  
  public static int sum(int... numbers, String message) {  // Error: varargs parameter must be the last
    int total = sum(numbers);
    System.out.println(message);
    
    return total;
  }
}
```

In the above code, we define two overloaded `sum` methods. The first method `sum(int... numbers)` accepts zero or more integers and calculates their sum. This is done by using the `varargs` feature, denoted by the `...` notation after the parameter type.

However, when we try to define the second overloaded `sum` method with an additional `String` parameter, we encounter an error. In Java, **varargs parameters must be the last parameter** defined in the method signature. Therefore, the provided code will not compile.

To overcome this error and still achieve the desired functionality, we can modify our code as follows:

```java
public class Calculator {
  public static int sum(int... numbers) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int number : numbers) {
      total += number;
    }
    
    return total;
  }
  
  public static int sum(String message, int... numbers) {
    int total = sum(numbers);
    System.out.println(message);
    
    return total;
  }
}
```

In the modified code, we switch the positions of the `String` parameter and the `int... numbers` parameter. This allows us to define a valid overload where we can provide a `String` message along with the integers to be summed.

By using this approach, we can call the `sum` method with either just the integers, or both the integers and a message:

```java
int result1 = Calculator.sum(1, 2, 3);  // 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
int result2 = Calculator.sum("The sum is:", 1, 2, 3); // 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 and prints "The sum is:"
```

In conclusion, when overloading methods that involve a combination of `varargs` and regular parameters in Java, remember that `varargs` parameters must be defined as the last parameter. By adhering to this rule, you can provide flexible and versatile methods that suit various scenarios.
