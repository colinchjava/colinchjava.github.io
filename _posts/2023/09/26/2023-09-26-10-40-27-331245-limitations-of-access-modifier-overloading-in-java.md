Access modifiers in Java are used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables within a program. They play a vital role in encapsulation and ensuring the proper abstraction of code. While access modifiers can be overloaded, there are some limitations that developers should be aware of.

## 1. Ambiguity in Access Levels

Java supports four access levels: public, protected, default (also known as package-private), and private. When overloading access modifiers, it's important to note that the resulting access level is determined by the lowest access level of the overloaded methods.

For example, let's consider a class with two overloaded methods:

```java
public class Example {
    public void doSomething() {
        // Method implementation
    }

    private void doSomething(int value) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```
In this example, the second overloaded method has a private access modifier. However, even though the first method has a public access modifier, both methods are effectively private. This means that any code outside of the `Example` class will not have access to these methods.

## 2. Inability to Increase Access Levels

When overloading access modifiers, it is not possible to increase the access level of a method. In other words, if a method is originally declared with a lower access level, it cannot be overloaded to have a higher access level.

For instance, let's consider the following code snippet:

```java
public class Example {
    private void doSomething() {
        // Method implementation
    }

    public void doSomething(String value) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

In this case, the first method has a private access modifier, while the second method has a public access modifier. This results in a compile-time error because the overloaded method with the higher access level cannot be declared.

## Conclusion

While access modifier overloading can be useful in certain scenarios, it's important to understand its limitations. The resulting access level is determined by the lowest access level of the overloaded methods, and it is not possible to increase the access level of a method.

By understanding these limitations, developers can effectively utilize access modifiers while adhering to the principles of encapsulation and code abstraction.
