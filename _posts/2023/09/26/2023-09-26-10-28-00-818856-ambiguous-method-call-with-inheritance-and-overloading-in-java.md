Java is an object-oriented programming language that supports inheritance and method overloading. While these features provide flexibility and code reusability, they can sometimes lead to ambiguous method calls. In this blog post, we will explore what an ambiguous method call is and how it can occur in Java.

## Understanding Ambiguous Method Calls

In Java, an ambiguous method call occurs when there are multiple candidate methods that can be matched with the given arguments. This ambiguity arises when two or more methods have the same name but differ in their parameter types.

Consider the following scenario:

```java
class BaseClass {
    public void display(int num) {
        System.out.println("Displaying an integer: " + num);
    }
}

class DerivedClass extends BaseClass {
    public void display(String str) {
        System.out.println("Displaying a string: " + str);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DerivedClass derivedObj = new DerivedClass();
        derivedObj.display(10); // Ambiguous method call error
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have a base class `BaseClass` and a derived class `DerivedClass` that inherits from `BaseClass`. Both classes define a method called `display`, but with different parameter types (`int` in `BaseClass` and `String` in `DerivedClass`).

## Resolving the Ambiguity

When we try to call the `display` method on a `DerivedClass` object with an `int` argument, a compilation error occurs, signaling an ambiguous method call. This is because the Java compiler cannot determine which method to invoke due to the similarity in method names and different parameter types.

To resolve this ambiguity, we can explicitly narrow down the method call by using a typecast. Here's an updated version of the code snippet:

```java
class BaseClass {
    public void display(int num) {
        System.out.println("Displaying an integer: " + num);
    }
}

class DerivedClass extends BaseClass {
    public void display(String str) {
        System.out.println("Displaying a string: " + str);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DerivedClass derivedObj = new DerivedClass();
        derivedObj.display((String)null); // Explicitly call the String version
    }
}
```

In the modified code, we explicitly typecast `null` to `String` in the method call, indicating that we want to invoke the `display` method with the `String` parameter from the `DerivedClass`.

## Conclusion

Understanding how ambiguous method calls can occur in Java, especially in scenarios involving inheritance and method overloading, is crucial for writing efficient and error-free code. By using typecasting or other explicit disambiguation techniques, we can resolve these issues and ensure that the appropriate methods are called.
