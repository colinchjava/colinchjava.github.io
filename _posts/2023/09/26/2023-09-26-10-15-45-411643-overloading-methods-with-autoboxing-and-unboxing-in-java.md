In Java, method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This allows you to perform different actions based on the number and types of arguments passed to the method. When it comes to autoboxing and unboxing, method overloading can be particularly useful.

Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class, and unboxing is the reverse process of converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type. This feature was introduced in Java 5 to simplify coding by eliminating the need for manual conversions.

When overloading methods with autoboxing and unboxing, the Java compiler will automatically choose the most specific method that matches the arguments.

Here's a simple example to illustrate overloading methods with autoboxing and unboxing:

```java
public class Example {
  public void printNumber(int num) {
    System.out.println("Printing an integer: " + num);
  }

  public void printNumber(Integer num) {
    System.out.println("Printing an Integer: " + num);
  }

  public void printNumber(double num) {
    System.out.println("Printing a double: " + num);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Example example = new Example();
    example.printNumber(10);
    example.printNumber(20.5);
    example.printNumber(new Integer(30));
  }
}
```

In this example, we have defined three overloaded methods with different parameter types: `int`, `Integer`, and `double`. In the `main` method, we create an instance of the `Example` class and invoke the `printNumber` method with different arguments.

When `printNumber` is called with the argument `10`, the `printNumber(int num)` method is selected because `10` is an `int`.

Similarly, when `printNumber` is called with the argument `20.5`, the `printNumber(double num)` method is selected because `20.5` is a `double`.

When `printNumber` is called with the argument `new Integer(30)`, the `printNumber(Integer num)` method is selected due to autoboxing. The `new Integer(30)` is automatically converted to an `Integer` object, matching the method's parameter type.

By overloading methods with autoboxing and unboxing, you can handle different types of arguments without needing to manually convert them. This enhances the flexibility and readability of your code.

So, the next time you need to handle different types of arguments in your methods, remember to take advantage of autoboxing and unboxing and make use of the power of method overloading in Java!
