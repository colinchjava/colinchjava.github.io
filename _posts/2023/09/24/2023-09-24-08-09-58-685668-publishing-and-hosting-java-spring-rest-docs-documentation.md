Java Spring REST Docs is a powerful framework that allows developers to generate comprehensive documentation for their RESTful APIs. Once the documentation is generated, it needs to be published and hosted so that it can be easily accessible to other developers or consumers of the API. In this blog post, we will explore different options for publishing and hosting Java Spring REST Docs documentation.

## Option 1: GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a simple and effective way to host static websites, including documentation. To publish and host Java Spring REST Docs documentation using GitHub Pages, you can follow these steps:

1. Generate the documentation using the Spring REST Docs framework. This will produce a set of static HTML files.

2. Create a new repository on GitHub and push the generated documentation files to this repository.

3. In the repository settings, navigate to the GitHub Pages section, and choose the branch from which you want to serve your documentation.

4. Once the settings are saved, GitHub Pages will generate a URL where your documentation will be available. It could be something like `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name/`.

5. Share this URL with others, and they will be able to access your Java Spring REST Docs documentation.

Using GitHub Pages for hosting your documentation is convenient as it provides a simple way to version and maintain your documentation over time.

## Option 2: Using a Dedicated Documentation Hosting Service

Several dedicated documentation hosting services provide advanced features specifically designed for hosting API documentation. Some popular options include:

### 1. Swagger UI

Swagger UI is a popular open-source tool for documenting and interactively exploring REST APIs. It can be easily integrated with Java Spring REST Docs to render the generated documentation in a user-friendly format.

To use Swagger UI, you need to generate the Swagger specification for your API using Spring REST Docs. This specification file can then be served by a Swagger UI instance, either through GitHub Pages or by hosting it on your own server.

### 2. ReadMe

ReadMe is a comprehensive documentation hosting service that provides features such as API explorer, versioning, and integration with source control systems. It offers a user-friendly interface, making it easy to maintain and update your Java Spring REST Docs documentation.

To use ReadMe, you can export your generated documentation as a static HTML file and upload it to ReadMe. It will take care of hosting and providing a convenient interface for your API documentation.

## Conclusion

Publishing and hosting Java Spring REST Docs documentation is an essential step in making it accessible to developers and other stakeholders. Whether you choose GitHub Pages, Swagger UI, or a dedicated documentation hosting service like ReadMe, ensure that your documentation is easy to find, navigate, and consume. **#Java** **#RESTDocs**
