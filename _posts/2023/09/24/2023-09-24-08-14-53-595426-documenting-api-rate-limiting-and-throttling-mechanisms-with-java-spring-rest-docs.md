API rate limiting and throttling are essential mechanisms used to control the number of requests that a client can make to an API within a specified time frame. These mechanisms help to protect the API from abuse, prevent server overload, and ensure fair usage among clients. In this blog post, we will explore how to document these rate limiting and throttling mechanisms using Java Spring REST Docs.

## What is Java Spring REST Docs?

Java Spring REST Docs is a powerful tool that allows developers to generate documentation for RESTful APIs based on the Spring framework. With Spring REST Docs, you can document API endpoints, request and response parameters, and other important information, making it easier for API consumers to understand and use your API.

## Documenting Rate Limiting Mechanism

To document the rate limiting mechanism of an API using Java Spring REST Docs, follow these steps:

1. Add a code example to your API documentation that demonstrates how the rate limiting header is included in the API response.

```java
ResponseEntity<Customer> getCustomer(@PathVariable("customerId") String customerId) {
    // Your implementation here
    // ...
    HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
    headers.add("X-RateLimit-Limit", "1000");
    headers.add("X-RateLimit-Remaining", "999");
    headers.add("X-RateLimit-Reset", "1633124267");
    return ResponseEntity.ok().headers(headers).body(customer);
}
```

2. Explain the rate limiting mechanism in your documentation, including details on what each rate limiting header represents:

   - The `X-RateLimit-Limit` header indicates the total number of requests allowed within a specific time frame.
   - The `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header indicates the number of remaining requests that the client can make.
   - The `X-RateLimit-Reset` header indicates the timestamp when the rate limit will reset.

## Documenting Throttling Mechanism

Throttling is another important mechanism to prevent clients from sending requests too frequently. To document the throttling mechanism using Java Spring REST Docs, follow these steps:

1. Add a code example to your API documentation that demonstrates how the API responds when the client exceeds the maximum allowable request rate.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS)
@ExceptionHandler(ThrottlingException.class)
public void handleThrottlingException() {
    // Your implementation here
    // ...
}
```

2. Explain the throttling mechanism in your documentation, including information on the HTTP response status code (`429 Too Many Requests`) and any additional details or limitations.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to document API rate limiting and throttling mechanisms using Java Spring REST Docs. By documenting these mechanisms, you can provide crucial information to API consumers, helping them understand and adhere to the rate limits and throttling rules of your API.

With the use of Java Spring REST Docs, you can easily generate comprehensive documentation that includes not only rate limiting and throttling information but also other important API details. This improves the developer experience and promotes efficient and responsible API usage.
