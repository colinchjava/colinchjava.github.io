API documentation is an essential component of any software development project. It helps developers and other stakeholders understand the functionality and usage of the APIs provided by a system. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate Java Spring REST Docs with Confluence, a popular documentation collaboration tool, to generate and publish comprehensive API documentation.

## What is Java Spring REST Docs?

Java Spring REST Docs is a powerful tool that generates documentation for RESTful APIs based on your tests. It provides a way to document your APIs in a concise and standardized format by leveraging the existing test cases. It integrates seamlessly with the Spring Framework and works well with popular testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito.

## Why use Confluence for API documentation?

Confluence is a widely used documentation collaboration tool that enables teams to create, organize, and share documentation effortlessly. It offers a user-friendly interface, version control, and collaboration features that make it an ideal choice for documenting APIs. By integrating Java Spring REST Docs with Confluence, you can automate the process of generating and publishing API documentation, saving time and effort.

## How to integrate Java Spring REST Docs with Confluence?

Integrating Java Spring REST Docs with Confluence is a straightforward process. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Set up Java Spring REST Docs**: First, you need to set up Java Spring REST Docs in your project. Add the necessary dependencies to your build configuration file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven projects), and write test cases using the RestAssured library to test your RESTful APIs. Spring REST Docs will generate documentation based on these test cases.

2. **Generate documentation snippets**: During the test execution, Java Spring REST Docs will generate documentation snippets in a predefined format. These snippets contain information about the API requests, responses, and expected outcomes.

3. **Configure Confluence REST API credentials**: To publish documentation to Confluence, you need to configure your credentials. Create a Confluence user account and generate an API token that will be used for authentication.

4. **Create a Confluence page for API documentation**: In Confluence, create a new page or choose an existing page to host the API documentation. Add relevant sections and content placeholders for different API endpoints.

5. **Publish documentation to Confluence**: Finally, use the Confluence REST API to publish the generated documentation snippets to the appropriate placeholders in the Confluence page. Make sure to map the snippets correctly to their respective API endpoints.

## Conclusion

Integrating Java Spring REST Docs with Confluence provides an efficient and automated way to generate and publish API documentation. This integration allows developers to leverage the power of Java Spring REST Docs and the collaborative features of Confluence to create comprehensive and up-to-date API documentation. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can streamline your API documentation process and improve collaboration within your development team.
