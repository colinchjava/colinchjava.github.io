In modern software development, generating documentation for REST APIs is essential. It ensures that developers, stakeholders, and even external consumers understand how to interact with the API. One popular tool for documenting REST APIs in the Java ecosystem is Java Spring REST Docs. It provides a convenient way to generate comprehensive and user-friendly documentation for Spring-based RESTful APIs.

## What is Java Spring REST Docs?

Java Spring REST Docs is an open-source library that helps generate documentation for RESTful APIs created with the Spring framework. It leverages Spring MVC's testing infrastructure to generate snippets of API request/response interactions as well as custom documentation templates in various formats, including HTML, Markdown, and AsciiDoc. These snippets can be combined with the documentation templates to create well-structured and easily consumable API documentation.

## Code Generation and Scaffolding Tools

To enhance the integration of Java Spring REST Docs with your development workflow, it can be beneficial to leverage code generation and scaffolding tools. These tools automate the process of generating code and project structure, making it easier to produce consistent and well-documented APIs.

### Swagger Codegen

[Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) is a popular code generation tool that simplifies the process of developing APIs using the OpenAPI Specification. It allows you to generate server stubs, client SDKs, and API documentation from an OpenAPI definition. By integrating Swagger Codegen with Java Spring REST Docs, you can automatically generate API documentation as part of the build process.

To integrate Swagger Codegen with Java Spring REST Docs, follow these steps:

1. Define your API using the OpenAPI Specification.
2. Configure Swagger Codegen to generate the necessary code and documentation templates.
3. Use Java Spring REST Docs to generate API documentation snippets during testing, capturing request and response details.
4. Incorporate the generated snippets into the Swagger Codegen output, producing a complete and up-to-date API documentation artifact.

### SpringDoc

[SpringDoc](https://springdoc.org/) is another popular tool for generating API documentation from Spring Boot applications. It supports OpenAPI 3 and integrates well with Java Spring REST Docs. SpringDoc provides automatic generation of an OpenAPI 3 documentation endpoint, which can be customized to include additional information captured through Java Spring REST Docs.

To integrate SpringDoc with Java Spring REST Docs, follow these steps:

1. Add the SpringDoc dependencies to your Spring Boot project.
2. Annotate your controllers and endpoints with appropriate Swagger annotations.
3. During testing, use Java Spring REST Docs to generate API documentation snippets.
4. Incorporate the generated snippets into the SpringDoc OpenAPI 3 documentation endpoint, enriching the automatically generated documentation with detailed request and response examples.

## Conclusion

Integrating Java Spring REST Docs with code generation and scaffolding tools brings significant benefits to the API development workflow. By automatically generating comprehensive and up-to-date API documentation, these tools help ensure consistency and improve collaboration among developers, stakeholders, and API consumers. Whether you choose to leverage Swagger Codegen or SpringDoc, the integration with Java Spring REST Docs empowers you with powerful documentation capabilities for your Spring-based RESTful APIs.
