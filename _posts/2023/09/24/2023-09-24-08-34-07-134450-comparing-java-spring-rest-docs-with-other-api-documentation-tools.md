When it comes to documenting RESTful APIs in Java, there are several tools available. Two popular options are Java Spring REST Docs and Swagger. Below, we will compare these two tools and highlight their key differences.

### Java Spring REST Docs

Java Spring REST Docs is a powerful library that works alongside Spring MVC to generate documentation for RESTful APIs. It allows developers to write documentation in a concise and maintainable way, using snippets and annotations to describe API endpoints and request/response payloads. 

One of the main advantages of Java Spring REST Docs is its seamless integration with unit tests. By writing tests with snippets representing the desired documentation, developers can ensure that the generated documentation accurately reflects the behavior of their APIs.

Another benefit of Java Spring REST Docs is its support for multiple output formats, including HTML, Markdown, and AsciiDoc. This makes it flexible and compatible with various documentation workflows.

### Swagger

Swagger, now known as OpenAPI, is a widely-used framework for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs. Its main strength lies in its comprehensive tooling ecosystem, which includes not only documentation generation but also API testing, mocking, and code generation.

With Swagger, API documentation is written in YAML or JSON files using a simple and intuitive syntax. The documentation can be hosted and served by the Swagger UI, a user-friendly interface that allows developers and consumers to explore and interact with the API.

Swagger also provides powerful features like automatic generation of API clients and server stubs, making it easier for developers to consume or build APIs.

### Comparison

While both Java Spring REST Docs and Swagger are popular choices for API documentation, they have different focuses and use cases. 

Java Spring REST Docs excels in providing integration with unit tests, ensuring that the documentation matches the API's behavior. It is a good choice if you are already using Spring MVC and want a seamless documentation workflow.

On the other hand, Swagger offers a more comprehensive ecosystem, with features like API mocking and code generation that can speed up API development. It is a better fit if you are looking for a complete solution for API design, documentation, and testing.

In terms of output formats, Java Spring REST Docs supports HTML, Markdown, and AsciiDoc, while Swagger primarily generates interactive API documentation using the Swagger UI.
