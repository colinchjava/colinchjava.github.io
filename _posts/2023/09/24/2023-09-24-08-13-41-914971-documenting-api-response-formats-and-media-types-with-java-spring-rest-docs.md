When building a RESTful API using Java Spring, it is crucial to provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the API response formats and media types. This documentation helps API consumers understand how to interact with the API and process the responses correctly.

In this blog post, we will explore how to document API response formats and media types using Java Spring REST Docs, a powerful tool that integrates seamlessly with the Java Spring framework.

## What is Java Spring REST Docs?

Java Spring REST Docs is a library that generates documentation for your API endpoints by automatically capturing and documenting the request and response payloads. It leverages the power of Spring's testing infrastructure, allowing you to write concise and expressive documentation in a familiar and developer-friendly way.

## Documenting API Response Formats

To document the API response formats, we need to define the structure and schema of the response payload. This can be done using the Java Spring REST Docs' built-in support for Asciidoctor, a lightweight markup language. Here's an example:

```
// Define the response format
*Response Format*

The API endpoint returns a JSON object with the following properties:

- `id` (integer): The unique identifier of the resource.
- `name` (string): The name of the resource.
- `age` (integer): The age of the resource.

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}

```

In the example above, we have defined the structure and schema of the API response format using a combination of plain text and Asciidoctor markup. This documentation makes it clear to the API consumers what to expect when they make a request to the endpoint.

## Documenting Media Types

In addition to documenting the API response format, it is important to specify the media types that the API supports for request and response payloads. This helps API consumers understand which formats they can use to interact with the API.

Java Spring REST Docs provides a simple way to document media types using the `mediaType` method of the `MockMvcRequestBuilders` class. Here's an example:

```java
// Document the media type
mockMvc.perform(get("/api/resource")
        .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
        .andExpect(status().isOk())
        .andDo(document("api-resource",
                responseFields(
                        fieldWithPath("id").description("The unique identifier of the resource."),
                        fieldWithPath("name").description("The name of the resource."),
                        fieldWithPath("age").description("The age of the resource.")
                ),
                responseFields().andWithPrefix("links[].", linkFields())
        ));
```

In the example above, we are documenting that the API supports the JSON media type for the response payload. This information can be captured and included in the generated API documentation.

## Conclusion

Properly documenting API response formats and media types is essential for providing a clear and useful API documentation. Java Spring REST Docs is a great tool that makes it easy to document the structure and schema of the response payload, as well as the supported media types.

By using Java Spring REST Docs in your API development workflow, you can ensure that your API documentation stays up-to-date and informative, making it easier for developers to consume and integrate your API.
