Java Spring REST Docs is a powerful tool for documenting RESTful APIs in Spring projects. It generates documentation in AsciiDoc format by default, but it also allows customization of the output and styling to match your project's branding or visual preferences. In this blog post, we will explore how to customize the output and styling of Java Spring REST Docs documentation.

## Adding Custom CSS Styles

Customizing the styling of the generated documentation can be accomplished by adding custom CSS styles. To do this, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new CSS file in your project, for example, `custom-styles.css`.
2. Add your desired custom styles to the CSS file, such as changing font styles, adding background colors, or modifying headings.
3. Save the CSS file in a location accessible to your project.

### Linking the CSS File

Once you have created your custom CSS file, you need to link it to the generated documentation. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Spring RestDocs configuration file, typically `snippets/index.adoc` in your project.
2. Locate the `:doctype: api` line.
3. Immediately below it, add the following line to include your custom CSS file:

   ```
   :linkcss: stylesheets/custom-styles.css
   ```

4. Save the changes and rebuild your documentation.

## Adding Custom JavaScript

In addition to customizing styles, you may also want to add custom JavaScript to enhance the functionality of the generated documentation. To add custom JavaScript, follow these steps:

1. Create a new JavaScript file in your project, for example, `custom-script.js`.
2. Add your desired JavaScript code to the file, such as additional interactivity or behavior.
3. Save the JavaScript file in a location accessible to your project.

### Linking the JavaScript File

To link your custom JavaScript file to the generated documentation, follow these steps:

1. Open the Spring RestDocs configuration file, typically `snippets/index.adoc` in your project.
2. Locate the `:doctype: api` line.
3. Immediately below it, add the following line to include your custom JavaScript file:

   ```
   :script: javascripts/custom-script.js
   ```

4. Save the changes and rebuild your documentation.

## Conclusion

Customizing the output and styling of Java Spring REST Docs documentation allows you to present your API documentation in a visually appealing and consistent manner. By adding custom CSS styles and JavaScript, you can match your documentation to your project's branding and enhance its functionality. Experiment with different styles and scripts to create documentation that meets your specific requirements.
