In the fast-paced world of software development, it is crucial to have robust API versioning and backward compatibility strategies in place. As APIs evolve over time, it's important to ensure that existing clients can continue to function without any disruptions while also introducing new features and improvements for newer clients.

In this blog post, we will explore how to effectively document API versioning and backward compatibility using Java Spring REST Docs. So let's dive in!

### API Versioning

API versioning is the process of managing different versions of an API to ensure smooth transitions and maintain backward compatibility. There are several strategies for versioning APIs, such as using URL paths, query parameters, headers, or content negotiation.

When documenting API versioning with Java Spring REST Docs, it is essential to include the versioning information in the API documentation for better clarity and understanding. You can achieve this by annotating the API endpoints with the appropriate versioning information.

For example, consider the following Endpoint in a Java Spring RESTful API:

```java
@GetMapping(value = "/users/{id}", headers = "X-API-Version=1")
public ResponseEntity<User> getUserByIdV1(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
    // Implementation details
}
```

In the above code snippet, we are using the `headers` attribute to specify the API version as `X-API-Version=1`. This approach allows clients to specify the required version in the request header.

To document this API endpoint using Java Spring REST Docs, you can leverage the `RequestHeadersSnippet` class to include the versioning information in the generated documentation. Here's an example:

```java
this.mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/users/1")
    .header("X-API-Version", "1"))
    .andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.status().isOk())
    .andDo(MockMvcRestDocumentation.document("getUserById", 
        requestHeaders(
            headerWithName("X-API-Version").description("API Version")
        ),
        // Other snippets for response, path parameters, response fields, etc.
    ));
```

By including the `headerWithName("X-API-Version").description("API Version")` snippet in the documentation, you provide clear instructions to clients on how to specify the API version.

### Backward Compatibility

Ensuring backward compatibility is crucial when evolving the APIs to avoid breaking changes for the existing clients. It involves making changes without breaking the functionality or causing disruptions for the clients using the older versions of the API.

To document backward compatibility with Java Spring REST Docs, it is essential to clearly indicate which parts of the API are deprecated and when they will be removed. You can achieve this by using annotations provided by the Spring Framework, such as `@deprecated` and `@ScheduledForRemoval`.

When documenting deprecated endpoints or fields in the API, you can use the `deprecated` snippet to indicate that the particular API element is deprecated. Here's an example:

```java
@GetMapping(value = "/users/{id}")
@Deprecated(since = "1.0", forRemoval = true)
public ResponseEntity<User> getUserById(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
    // Implementation details
}
```

To document this deprecated API endpoint using Java Spring REST Docs, you can add the `deprecated` snippet in the generated documentation. Here's how it can be done:

```java
this.mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/users/1"))
    .andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.status().isOk())
    .andDo(MockMvcRestDocumentation.document("getUserById", 
        // Other snippets for request, response, path parameters, response fields, etc.
        deprecated()
    ));
```

By including the `deprecated()` snippet, the documentation clearly indicates that the API element is deprecated and provides additional details on when it will be removed. This information helps developers understand that they should consider migrating to newer versions of the API.

### Conclusion

Documenting API versioning and backward compatibility is important for maintaining smooth transitions, supporting existing clients, and enabling the introduction of new features. With Java Spring REST Docs, you can effectively document API versioning using different strategies and clearly communicate backward compatibility information.

By following the practices presented in this blog post, you can create comprehensive API documentation that provides valuable information to developers and ensures a seamless experience for both current and future clients.
