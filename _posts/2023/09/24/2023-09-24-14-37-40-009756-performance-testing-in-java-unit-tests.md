### Why Perform Performance Testing in Unit Tests?

Unit tests are primarily focused on verifying the correctness of individual units of code, but they can also be utilized for performance testing. By including performance tests within your unit testing framework, you can automate the process of performance testing and easily integrate it into your continuous integration (CI) pipeline. This allows for quicker feedback and early detection of performance bottlenecks.

### Setting Up Performance Testing in JUnit

To perform performance testing in JUnit, we can leverage the **JUnitPerf** library. This library extends JUnit and provides additional annotations and classes specifically designed for performance testing.

First, let's add the JUnitPerf dependency to our project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>junitperf</groupId>
        <artifactId>junitperf</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.2</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Writing Performance Tests with JUnitPerf

To write a performance test, we can use the `@PerfTest` and `@Required` annotations provided by JUnitPerf. The `@PerfTest` annotation is used to denote a performance test method, while the `@Required` annotation sets performance requirements for the test.

Let's assume we have a method `calculateSum()` in the `Calculator` class that we want to performance test. Here's an example of how we can write a performance test for this method using JUnitPerf:

```java
import junit.extensions.TestSetup;
import junit.framework.Test;
import junitperf.*;

public class CalculatorPerfTest extends TestCase {

    private Calculator calculator;

    public void setUp() {
        calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    @PerfTest(invocations = 100, threads = 10)
    @Required(max = 50, totalTime = 1000)
    public void testCalculateSumPerformance() {
        int result = calculator.calculateSum(5, 10);
        assertEquals(15, result);
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `testCalculateSumPerformance()` method is annotated with `@PerfTest` to indicate it as a performance test. The `invocations` attribute specifies the number of times the method should be invoked, while the `threads` attribute sets the number of concurrent threads to run.

The `@Required` annotation is used to set performance requirements. In this case, we have set a maximum response time (`max`) of 50 milliseconds and a total execution time (`totalTime`) of 1000 milliseconds. If the performance requirements are not met, the test will fail.

### Running Performance Tests

To run the performance tests, we can execute the JUnit tests as we would normally do for unit tests. If you are using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, you can run the tests using the `test` command.

### Conclusion

By incorporating performance testing within Java unit tests, we can catch and address performance issues early in the development process. JUnitPerf provides a convenient way to write performance tests and automate the performance testing process. This allows for quicker feedback and enhanced application performance. So, start integrating performance testing into your unit tests and ensure your Java applications are optimized and performant.
