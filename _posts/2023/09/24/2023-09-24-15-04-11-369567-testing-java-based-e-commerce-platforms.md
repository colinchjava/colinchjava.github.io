```java
public class ShoppingCart {
    private List<Item> items;

    public ShoppingCart() {
        items = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addItem(Item item) {
        items.add(item);
    }

    public void removeItem(Item item) {
        items.remove(item);
    }

    public double calculateTotalPrice() {
        double total = 0.0;
        for (Item item : items) {
            total += item.getPrice();
        }
        return total;
    }
}

public class Item {
    private String name;
    private double price;

    public Item(String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have a simple implementation of a shopping cart in Java. This can serve as a starting point for building the shopping cart functionality in an e-commerce platform.

Remember to thoroughly evaluate your requirements and consider all factors before choosing a Java-based e-commerce platform. Happy coding and happy selling!
