With the continuous development and evolution of APIs, managing versioning becomes a crucial aspect of API lifecycle management. In this blog post, we will explore how to effectively manage API versioning in Java Spring REST Docs documentation.

## Why API versioning is important?

As APIs evolve and change over time, it is important to ensure backward compatibility and avoid breaking existing client integrations. API versioning allows developers to introduce new features or modifications while still supporting the existing functionality.

## Different approaches to API versioning

There are several approaches to versioning an API, including:

1. **URL versioning**: In this approach, the version number is included as a part of the URL. For example, `https://api.example.com/v1/users` and `https://api.example.com/v2/users`. This approach is straightforward but can clutter the URL and make it less readable.

2. **Header versioning**: In header versioning, the version number is sent as a custom header in the API request. For example, adding `X-API-Version: 1` to the HTTP headers. This approach allows for cleaner and more readable URLs but requires additional work on the consumer side to set the correct header value.

3. **Media type versioning**: Media type versioning uses different MIME types to indicate the API version. For example, using `application/vnd.company.v1+json` and `application/vnd.company.v2+json` as the media types. This approach can be more complex to implement but provides flexibility in handling versioning.

## Documenting API versions with Java Spring REST Docs

Java Spring REST Docs is a popular documentation tool that helps in generating API documentation with code examples and snippets. When it comes to documenting API versions, we can follow the below approach:

1. **Documenting URL versioning**: If you are using URL versioning, you can include the version number in the URL path and document the different versions separately. This helps in clearly showcasing the differences between different versions of the API.

2. **Documenting header or media type versioning**: In header or media type versioning, you can include information about the versioning approach and how to set the appropriate headers or media types in the documentation. This ensures that consumers of the API understand how to work with different versions.

## Conclusion

Managing API versioning is essential in maintaining a robust and scalable API ecosystem. With Java Spring REST Docs, you can effectively document API versions and provide clear guidelines to consumers on how to interact with different versions of the API. By choosing an appropriate versioning strategy and documenting it thoroughly, you can ensure smooth transitions and backward compatibility throughout the API lifecycle.
