As developers, we understand the importance of having comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for our APIs. One popular tool for documenting REST APIs is Java Spring REST Docs. It allows us to generate accurate and user-friendly documentation by leveraging test-driven development. In this article, we will explore how we can integrate Spring REST Docs with other API documentation tools to enhance our documentation workflow.

## Why integrate with other API documentation tools?

While Spring REST Docs provides great support for generating documentation directly from our integration tests, it may not cover every aspect of API documentation. Sometimes we may need additional features like interactive UI documentation, API management capabilities, or collaboration tools. This is where integrating with other API documentation tools comes in handy.

## Swagger UI

One popular API documentation tool is Swagger UI. It allows us to create interactive documentation that is easy to navigate and understand. By integrating Spring REST Docs with Swagger UI, we can combine the accurate and up-to-date documentation generated by Spring REST Docs with the interactive and visually appealing UI provided by Swagger UI.

To integrate Spring REST Docs with Swagger UI, we need to generate Swagger/OpenAPI specification files from our Spring REST Docs snippets. Spring REST Docs provides a plugin called `spring-restdocs-openapi` that allows us to generate the specification files in the OpenAPI format.

Once the specification files are generated, we can use Swagger UI to serve and render the documentation. Swagger UI provides an easy-to-use interface to explore the generated API documentation, including testing API calls directly from the browser.

## Postman

Postman is another popular API documentation tool that provides powerful features for building, testing, and documenting APIs. By integrating Spring REST Docs with Postman, we can leverage the strengths of both tools to create comprehensive API documentation.

To integrate Spring REST Docs with Postman, we can use the `postman` module of the `spring-restdocs-export-postman` project. This module allows us to export our Spring REST Docs snippets to a Postman collection. By importing this collection into Postman, we can have a fully-featured, executable API documentation that includes request examples, predefined test cases, and a user-friendly interface for API exploration.

## Summary

In this article, we explored the benefits of integrating Java Spring REST Docs with other API documentation tools. By combining the accurate and automated documentation generated by Spring REST Docs with the interactive and user-friendly features of tools like Swagger UI and Postman, we can create comprehensive and developer-friendly documentation.

Remember, documentation is crucial for the success of our APIs, as it helps developers understand how to consume them effectively. So, consider integrating Spring REST Docs with other API documentation tools to enhance your documentation workflow and provide the best experience for developers using your APIs.
