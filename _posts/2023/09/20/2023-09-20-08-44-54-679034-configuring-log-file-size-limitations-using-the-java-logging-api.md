The Java Logging API provides a flexible way to configure logging in Java applications. One common requirement is to limit the size of log files to avoid them becoming too large and taking up excessive disk space. In this blog post, we will explore how to configure log file size limitations using the Java Logging API.

## Step 1: Configure the log handler

The first step is to configure a log handler that will handle the log records and write them to the desired log file. In this example, we will use the `FileHandler` class, which is a built-in handler that writes log records to a file.

```java
import java.util.logging.*;

Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("myLogger");

try {
    FileHandler fileHandler = new FileHandler("logs/myapp.log", 1024 * 1024, 10);
    logger.addHandler(fileHandler);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the code snippet above, we create a `FileHandler` instance and pass in the log file name ("logs/myapp.log") as well as the maximum file size (1 MB) and the number of files to rotate (10). This means that when the log file reaches the specified size, it will be rotated and a new log file will be created.

## Step 2: Set the log file count limit

In addition to specifying the maximum file size, we can also limit the number of log files that are retained. This ensures that old log files are deleted once the limit is reached. To set the log file count limit, we can use the `setFileCount` method of the `FileHandler` class.

```java
fileHandler.setFileCount(10);
```

In the code snippet above, we set the log file count limit to 10. This means that only the most recent 10 log files will be retained, and any additional log files will be deleted.

## Step 3: Set the log file size limit

By default, the `FileHandler` class will rotate the log file when it reaches the specified size. However, if you want to rotate the log file based on a different criterion, such as daily or hourly rotation, you can use the `setLimit` method.

```java
fileHandler.setLimit(1024 * 1024); // Rotate the log file every 1 MB
```

In the code snippet above, we set the log file size limit to 1 MB. This means that the log file will be rotated and a new log file will be created every time it reaches 1 MB in size.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily configure log file size limitations using the Java Logging API. This helps ensure that log files do not become too large and consume excessive disk space. By setting the log file count limit and log file size limit, you can effectively manage your application's log files. #Java #Logger
