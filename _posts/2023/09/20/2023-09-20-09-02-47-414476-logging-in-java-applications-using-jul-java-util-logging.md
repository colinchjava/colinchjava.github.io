Logging is an essential aspect of software development, as it allows developers to track and debug issues in their applications. In the Java ecosystem, one logging framework that comes pre-packaged with the Java Development Kit (JDK) is JUL (Java Util Logging). 

JUL provides a simple and easy-to-use logging API for Java applications. It makes use of handlers and formatters to control the output of log messages. *With JUL, developers can quickly incorporate logging into their applications without the need for external dependencies.*

## Getting Started with JUL

To start using JUL in your Java application, you need to import the necessary classes:

```java
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import java.util.logging.Level;
```

Next, you can create an instance of the Logger class to start logging messages:

```java
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("myLogger");
```

The `getLogger()` method retrieves an instance of the logger with the given name. It is common practice to use the fully qualified class name as the logger name to distinguish loggers across the application.

## Logging Levels

JUL provides several logging levels to indicate the severity of a log message. They are listed in descending order of severity:

- `SEVERE`
- `WARNING`
- `INFO`
- `CONFIG`
- `FINE`
- `FINER`
- `FINEST`

When logging a message, you can specify the logging level to categorize it appropriately:

```java
logger.log(Level.INFO, "This is an informational log message");
```

In the example above, the log message is categorized as an "INFO" level message. You can also use convenience methods for different levels:

```java
logger.info("This is an informational log message");
```

## Logging Handlers and Formatters

JUL provides various handlers for controlling the output of log messages. The most commonly used handler is the `ConsoleHandler`, which directs log messages to the console.

To configure the handler, you can add it to the logger:

```java
ConsoleHandler consoleHandler = new ConsoleHandler();
logger.addHandler(consoleHandler);
```

You can also set a custom formatter for the handlers to format log messages according to your preferences:

```java
consoleHandler.setFormatter(new SimpleFormatter());
```

Here, we are using the `SimpleFormatter` class, which provides a basic formatting style. You can create your own formatter classes by implementing the `Formatter` interface.

## Configuring Logging Properties

JUL allows you to configure logging properties using a properties file. Create a `logging.properties` file in your project's resources directory and specify the desired configuration options.

For example, to set the log file path and level, you can add the following properties:

```properties
handlers=java.util.logging.FileHandler
.level=INFO
java.util.logging.FileHandler.level=INFO
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern=/path/to/logfile-%u-%g.log
java.util.logging.FileHandler.append=true
java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit=5000000
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count=2
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
```

In this example, we are configuring the `FileHandler` to write log messages to a file with a maximum size of 5MB. We are also specifying the log level as `INFO` and using the `SimpleFormatter`.

To load the properties file and apply the configuration, you can use the following code snippet:

```java
try {
    LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration(
            getClass().getResourceAsStream("/logging.properties"));
} catch (IOException e) {
    logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "Error loading logging configuration", e);
}
```

Replace "/logging.properties" with the path to your properties file.

## Conclusion

JUL (Java Util Logging) is a built-in logging framework in Java that provides a simple and easy-to-use API for logging in Java applications. By following the steps mentioned in this article, you can start incorporating logging into your Java applications and effectively track and debug issues.
