## 1. Using the try-catch block

The simplest way to log exceptions in Java is by using the try-catch block. This allows you to catch specific exceptions and log them with the help of a logging framework like **log4j** or **slf4j**. Here's an example:

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Log the exception
    logger.error("An exception occurred: {}", e.getMessage());
}
```
This approach allows you to customize the log message and include additional information about the exception, such as the stack trace or the values of relevant variables.

## 2. Using a global exception handler

In larger Java applications, it can be cumbersome to add try-catch blocks to every method. An alternative approach is to use a global exception handler. This is achieved by defining a class that implements the `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler` interface.

```java
public class GlobalExceptionHandler implements Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GlobalExceptionHandler.class);
    
    @Override
    public void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e) {
        logger.error("An uncaught exception occurred in thread {}: {}", t.getName(), e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

You then set the global exception handler for your application by calling `Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler()` at the application's entry point.

```java
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new GlobalExceptionHandler());
        
        // Rest of the application logic
    }
}
```

By using this approach, any uncaught exceptions that occur within your application will be logged by the global exception handler.

## Conclusion
Effectively logging exceptions is essential for properly monitoring and debugging Java applications. Whether you use try-catch blocks or a global exception handler, make sure to leverage a reliable logging framework to capture and analyze the exception details. This will help you identify and resolve issues quickly, ensuring the smooth operation of your application.
