In any software application, it is important to have a good logging mechanism to track and understand what is happening during the execution of the code. Java provides a built-in logging API that allows developers to write log messages to different output locations, including the console.

## Setting up the Java Logging API

To begin, we need to set up the Java Logging API in our application. Here are the steps:

1. Import the necessary Java Logging classes:
```java
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
```

2. Create a logger instance:
```java
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("myLogger");
```
The argument to `getLogger` is a string that represents the name of the logger. It is a best practice to use a unique name for each logger, typically based on the package name or class name.

## Writing log messages to the console

Once we have set up the logger, we can start writing log messages to the console. Here's an example:

```java
logger.info("This is an informational message");
logger.warning("This is a warning message");
logger.severe("This is a severe message");
```

In this example, we used three different levels of logging messages - `info`, `warning`, and `severe`. The messages will be displayed in the console with the respective log level prefix.

## Controlling log levels

The Java Logging API allows us to control the log message levels that are displayed in the console. You can set the log level for a specific logger or for the entire logging system.

To set the log level for a logger, you can use the following code snippet:
```java
logger.setLevel(Level.INFO);
```
This will set the log level of the logger to `INFO`, which means only messages with log level `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `SEVERE` will be displayed in the console.

To set the log level for the entire logging system, you can use the following code snippet:
```java
Logger.getLogger("").setLevel(Level.INFO);
```
This will set the log level of the root logger to `INFO`, affecting all loggers in the application.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to write log messages to the console using the Java Logging API. We explored how to set up the logging API, write log messages with different log levels, and control the log level settings. Proper logging helps in troubleshooting and understanding the behavior of your application, making it a crucial aspect of software development.
