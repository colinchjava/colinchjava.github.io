Method injection is a technique used in Java to achieve dynamic behavior and flexibility by injecting a method as a dependency. It allows you to pass a method as an argument to another method, enabling the recipient method to execute the injected method at the appropriate time.

## Why use Method Injection?

Method injection provides several benefits over traditional dependency injection:

1. **Flexibility**: With method injection, you can change the behavior of a method at runtime by injecting different methods. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in your codebase.

2. **Code Reusability**: Method injection promotes code reusability since you can inject the same method into multiple recipient methods, reducing code duplication.

3. **Testability**: Method injection makes it easier to unit test your code since you can replace the injected method with a test double for controlled testing.

## Implementation Example

Let's demonstrate method injection with a simple example. Suppose we have a `NotificationService` class responsible for sending notifications in different formats. We want to provide the flexibility to send notifications via email, SMS, or any other medium.

```java
public class NotificationService {
  
  public void sendNotification(String recipient, Method notifyMethod) {
    // Logic to preprocess notification
    
    // Execute the injected method
    try {
        notifyMethod.invoke(this, recipient);
    } catch (IllegalAccessException | IllegalArgumentException 
             | InvocationTargetException e) {
        // Handle exceptions
    }
  }
  
  public void sendEmail(String recipient) {
    // Logic to send email
  }
  
  public void sendSMS(String recipient) {
    // Logic to send SMS
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `sendNotification` method takes two arguments: the recipient and the method to be executed. It uses Java's reflection API to invoke the injected method.

To use method injection, we can invoke the `sendNotification` method and pass the desired notification method as an argument:

```java
NotificationService notificationService = new NotificationService();

Method emailMethod = notificationService.getClass().getMethod("sendEmail", String.class);
notificationService.sendNotification("example@example.com", emailMethod);

Method smsMethod = notificationService.getClass().getMethod("sendSMS", String.class);
notificationService.sendNotification("+123456789", smsMethod);

// Output: 
// Email sent to example@example.com
// SMS sent to +123456789
```

In the example above, we use method injection to dynamically choose between sending an email or SMS notification based on the passed method.

## Conclusion

Method injection provides a powerful way to achieve dynamic behavior and flexibility in Java code. By injecting methods as dependencies, you can change the behavior of a method at runtime and promote code reusability. It also enhances testability by allowing you to replace injected methods for unit testing.
