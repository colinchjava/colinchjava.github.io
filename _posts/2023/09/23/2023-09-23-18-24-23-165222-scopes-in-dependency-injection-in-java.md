Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern commonly used in Java applications to achieve loose coupling and increase modularity. In DI, dependencies of a class are injected into it rather than being created internally. This approach allows for easier testing, maintainability, and reusability of code.

One key concept in DI is the concept of scopes. Scopes determine the lifecycle and availability of a dependency within an application. In Java, there are several scopes commonly used in DI frameworks like Spring:

## 1. Singleton Scope
The singleton scope is the most common scope in DI. In this scope, only one instance of a dependency is created and shared throughout the entire application. This ensures that all classes have access to the same instance of the dependency, promoting consistency and reducing resource usage. To configure a class as a singleton, you can annotate it with `@Singleton` (in Spring) or use the appropriate configuration in other DI frameworks.

```java
@Singleton
public class MySingletonClass {
    // ...
}
```

## 2. Prototype Scope
The prototype scope creates a new instance of a dependency for every injection point. Unlike the singleton scope, each consuming class receives a unique instance of the dependency. This can be useful in situations where state isolation is required, or when the dependency maintains mutable state. To configure a class as a prototype, you can annotate it with `@Prototype` (in Spring) or use the corresponding configuration in other DI frameworks.

```java
@Prototype
public class MyPrototypeClass {
    // ...
}
```

## Conclusion
Understanding and utilizing scopes in dependency injection is crucial for building scalable and maintainable Java applications. By choosing the appropriate scope for your dependencies, you can effectively control their lifecycle and ensure that dependencies are used in a consistent and efficient manner.
