Arquillian is a powerful testing framework for Java applications that allows you to write integration tests and deploy them to different container environments. In this blog post, we will explore how to run Arquillian tests in different environments such as local development machines and CI/CD pipelines.

## Local Environment

When running Arquillian tests locally, you will typically have your development environment set up with the necessary containers or servers. Here are the steps to run Arquillian tests locally:

1. **Configure Arquillian**: Ensure that your project's `pom.xml` includes the necessary dependencies for Arquillian and the container adapters you intend to use.

2. **Setup Containers**: Install and configure the containers you need for your tests, such as JBoss, WildFly, Apache Tomcat, or any other compatible container.

3. **Write Tests**: Create your Arquillian test classes following the Arquillian guidelines. These tests should be able to automatically deploy and test your application on the configured containers.

4. **Run Tests**: Run your Arquillian tests using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle). The tests will deploy your application to the specified containers, execute the tests, and provide the test results.

## CI/CD Environment

Running Arquillian tests in a CI/CD environment is slightly different from running them locally. Here are the steps to run Arquillian tests in a CI/CD environment:

1. **Configure Build Tool**: Set up your CI/CD pipeline to use the same build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) that you use locally.

2. **Configure Containers**: Ensure that the necessary containers or servers are available within your CI/CD environment. You may need to have separate instances or services running for each environment or create isolated environments for each build.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: In your CI/CD pipeline, configure any environment variables needed for the containers or test configurations. These variables should be set according to your CI/CD tool's documentation.

4. **Build Project**: Build your project within the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that all necessary dependencies for Arquillian and the container adapters are available.

5. **Run Tests**: Execute your Arquillian tests using the build tool within the CI/CD pipeline. The tests should deploy the application to the configured containers, run the tests, and generate the test results.

6. **Test Reports**: Publish the generated test reports to the CI/CD pipeline's reporting system, which usually provides visual representations of test results, including pass/fail status, code coverage, and more.

Remember to **keep your tests isolated from production systems** to prevent accidental modifications or changes to your live environment during testing. 

Regardless of the environment, Arquillian simplifies the process of integration testing by providing a consistent and flexible framework. It allows you to test your application on multiple containers and ensures that your code works as expected in different deployment scenarios.
