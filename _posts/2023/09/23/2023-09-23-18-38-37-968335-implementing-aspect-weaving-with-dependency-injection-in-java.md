In object-oriented programming, **aspect weaving** is a technique used to separate cross-cutting concerns from the core logic of an application. **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern that allows objects to be passed their dependencies rather than creating them internally. In this article, we will explore how to combine aspect weaving with DI in Java to achieve clean and modular code.

## Setting Up the Project

1. Start by setting up a new Java project in your preferred development environment.
2. Add the necessary dependencies for your DI framework of choice. In this example, we will use **Spring Framework** for DI.
3. Include the dependencies for aspect weaving. Some popular libraries for this purpose are **AspectJ** and **Spring AOP**. Choose the one that best suits your requirements and add it to your project.

## Defining Aspects

Aspects in aspect-oriented programming (AOP) encapsulate cross-cutting concerns. They contain the logic that will be woven into the application at the designated join points. To define an aspect, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Java class for your aspect and annotate it with the `@Aspect` annotation provided by your chosen AOP library.
2. Define the specific advice you want to apply to your join points using annotations such as `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around`, etc.
3. Implement the advice logic within the corresponding method. This logic will be executed whenever the join point is encountered during runtime.

Here's an example aspect that logs method execution time:

```java
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;

@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.*.*(..))")
    public void logExecutionTime() {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        // Code to log method execution time
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long executionTime = endTime - startTime;
        System.out.println("Method executed in " + executionTime + "ms");
    }
}
```

## Configuring Dependency Injection

To configure DI in your Java application, you will usually define beans and their dependencies in a configuration file. Here's a basic example using Spring's DI:

1. Create an XML or Java-based configuration file (e.g., `application-context.xml` or `AppConfig.java`).
2. Define the beans that need to be injected, specifying their dependencies and any additional configurations.
3. Annotate your main application class with the `@ComponentScan` annotation to enable component scanning and automatic wiring of dependencies.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
public class AppConfig {
    // Bean definitions and other configurations
}
```

## Integrating Aspects with Dependency Injection

To integrate the aspects with DI, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your main application class is annotated with both `@Component` and `@Aspect` annotations.
2. Register the aspect bean in your DI configuration file or class.
3. Annotate your aspect methods with AOP pointcut expressions to specify when the advice should be applied.
4. Run your application, and the aspect will be woven into the relevant join points during runtime.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;

@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.*.*(..))")
    public void logExecutionTime() {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        // Code to log method execution time
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long executionTime = endTime - startTime;
        System.out.println("Method executed in " + executionTime + "ms");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

By combining aspect weaving with dependency injection in your Java application, you can achieve better separation of concerns and enhance code modularity. Aspects can be applied consistently across multiple join points without cluttering the core codebase. Experiment with different AOP libraries and DI frameworks to find the combination that works best for your project.
