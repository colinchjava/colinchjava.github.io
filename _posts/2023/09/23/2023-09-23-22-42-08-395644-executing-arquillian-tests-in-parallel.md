Arquillian is a popular testing framework for Java applications that provides a convenient way to write and execute integration tests. By default, Arquillian executes tests sequentially, which can be time-consuming for large test suites. However, with a few tweaks, you can configure Arquillian to run tests in parallel, significantly reducing the overall test execution time.

In this blog post, we will explore the steps necessary to execute Arquillian tests in parallel, leveraging the power of parallel test execution to speed up the feedback loop in your development process.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the details, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java JDK installed on your system
- Maven or Gradle build tool installed
- A Java project with Arquillian set up for integration tests

## Configuring Arquillian for Parallel Execution

To execute Arquillian tests in parallel, we need to make some configuration changes. Follow the steps below:

1. Open the `arquillian.xml` file located in the `src/test/resources/` directory of your project.
2. Add the following configuration within the `<container>` element:

```xml
<configuration>
   <property name="threads">4</property>
</configuration>
```

This configuration specifies the number of threads to be used for parallel execution. You can adjust the value according to your needs.

3. Update your test runner to enable parallel execution. If you are using JUnit, add the following annotation at the class level:

```java
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Concurrency(ConcurrencyMode.DYNAMIC)
public class YourTestClass {
   // your test code here
}
```

With these changes in place, Arquillian will now execute your tests in parallel, making use of the specified number of threads. This can significantly optimize your test execution time, especially for large test suites.

## Running Parallel Arquillian Tests

To run your Arquillian tests in parallel, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Build your project using Maven or Gradle:

```bash
# if using Maven
mvn clean install

# if using Gradle
./gradlew clean build
```

4. Execute your tests:

```bash
# if using Maven
mvn test

# if using Gradle
./gradlew test
```

With these commands, your Arquillian tests will be executed in parallel, and you will see a significant improvement in test execution time.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to execute Arquillian tests in parallel, leveraging the power of parallel test execution to reduce overall test execution time. By making some configuration changes, you can optimize your test suite and improve the feedback loop in your development process.

Using parallel execution for Arquillian tests is a great way to speed up your testing process, especially for large test suites. Give it a try and see the benefits for yourself!
