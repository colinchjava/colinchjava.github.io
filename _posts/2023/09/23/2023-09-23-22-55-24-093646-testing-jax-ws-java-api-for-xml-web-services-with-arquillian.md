In this blog post, we will explore how to test JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web Services) applications using Arquillian, a testing framework for Java applications. Testing web services is crucial to ensure the reliability and integrity of your application's functionality. Arquillian provides a seamless way to test JAX-WS endpoints by deploying them in a container and executing tests against the deployed application. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into testing JAX-WS with Arquillian, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Maven 
- Arquillian
- JAX-WS

## Setting up Arquillian for JAX-WS Testing

To get started, let's first add the necessary dependencies to the `pom.xml` file of your project:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.container</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-weld-ee-embedded-1.1</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.Alpha1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.protocol</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-protocol-servlet</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.14.Final</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Next, we need to configure Arquillian to use an embedded container. Create a file named `arquillian.xml` under the `src/test/resources` directory and add the following content:

```xml
<arquillian xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
                               http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">
    <container qualifier="weld-ee-embedded">
        <configuration>
            <property name="appPath">target/test.war</property>
        </configuration>
    </container>
</arquillian>
```

## Writing the JAX-WS Test

Let's assume we have a simple JAX-WS endpoint called `UserService` that exposes a method to retrieve user details. Here's an example of the endpoint:

```java
@WebService(name = "UserService")
public class UserService {

    @WebMethod
    public User getUser(String userId) {
        // Retrieve user details from the database
        User user = //...
        return user;
    }
}
```

To test this JAX-WS endpoint with Arquillian, create a new test class called `UserServiceTest` and add the following code:

```java
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class UserServiceTest {

    @Deployment
    public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class, "test.war")
                .addClass(UserService.class);
    }

    @WebServiceRef
    private UserService userService;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        // Perform any necessary setup before each test
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetUser() {
        // Test the getUser() method
    }
}
```

In the above test class, we use the `@RunWith` annotation from Arquillian to run the test. The `@Deployment` method creates a deployment archive that includes the `UserService` class. The `@WebServiceRef` annotation injects an instance of the JAX-WS endpoint into the test class, allowing us to invoke its methods in our tests.

## Running the JAX-WS Test

To run the JAX-WS test with Arquillian, execute the following Maven command:

```
mvn test
```

This will start the embedded container, deploy the JAX-WS endpoint, and execute the test methods in `UserServiceTest`. You will see the test results in your console, indicating whether the tests passed or failed.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to test JAX-WS endpoints using Arquillian. Arquillian provides a simple and efficient way to test JAX-WS applications by deploying them in an embedded container. By writing tests for your JAX-WS endpoints, you can ensure that your web services behave as expected and meet the requirements of your application.
