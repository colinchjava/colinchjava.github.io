In today's digital age, the need for secure data transmission and storage is more important than ever. Encryption is a widely used technique to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement encryption and decryption functionality in Java using Dependency Injection (DI) to improve code maintainability and flexibility.

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows objects to be decoupled from their dependencies. It promotes loose coupling by enabling the dependencies to be injected into the dependent objects rather than creating or managing them internally. This approach enhances code reusability and modularization.

## Encryption and Decryption Implementation

Let's start by creating an interface to define the contract for encryption and decryption operations:

```java
public interface EncryptionService {
    String encrypt(String plainText);
    String decrypt(String cipherText);
}
```

Next, we'll implement the encryption and decryption logic in a class that implements the `EncryptionService` interface:

```java
public class EncryptionServiceImpl implements EncryptionService {
    private final Encryptor encryptor;
    
    public EncryptionServiceImpl(Encryptor encryptor) {
        this.encryptor = encryptor;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String encrypt(String plainText) {
        // Encryption logic using the injected Encryptor instance
        return encryptor.encrypt(plainText);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String decrypt(String cipherText) {
        // Decryption logic using the injected Encryptor instance
        return encryptor.decrypt(cipherText);
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, the `EncryptionServiceImpl` class depends on the `Encryptor` interface. Rather than creating an instance of `Encryptor` internally, we delegate this responsibility to the DI framework.

To enable Dependency Injection, we can use popular DI frameworks like Spring or Google Guice. Here's an example of how to configure the DI framework using Spring's XML-based configuration:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
    
    <bean id="encryptor" class="com.example.EncryptorImpl" />
    
    <bean id="encryptionService" class="com.example.EncryptionServiceImpl">
        <constructor-arg ref="encryptor" />
    </bean>
    
</beans>
```

In the example above, the `encryptor` bean of type `EncryptorImpl` is defined. Next, the `encryptionService` bean is defined, which depends on the `encryptor` bean via constructor injection.

## Conclusion

By implementing encryption and decryption functionality with Dependency Injection in Java, we improve code maintainability and flexibility. The DI pattern allows us to decouple dependencies and promotes code reusability. It also makes it easier to swap out different implementations of the dependencies without altering the core logic.

Implementing encryption and decryption is crucial for secure data handling. With DI, we create more modular and maintainable code, making it easier to adapt to future changes and enhancements.
