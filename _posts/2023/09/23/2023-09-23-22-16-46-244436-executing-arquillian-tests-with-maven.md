Arquillian is a testing framework that allows you to write integration tests that can be executed in a real container environment. It provides a seamless way to test your application in a controlled, real-world setting.

In this blog post, we will discuss how to execute Arquillian tests using Maven, a popular build tool for Java projects. By integrating Arquillian with Maven, you can easily automate the execution of your tests within your Maven build pipeline.

## Setting Up Arquillian with Maven

To start, you need to add the Arquillian dependencies to your Maven project. Open your project's `pom.xml` file and add the following dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-junit-container</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.0.Final</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.shrinkwrap.resolver</groupId>
    <artifactId>shrinkwrap-resolver-impl-maven</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.2</version>
</dependency>
```

These dependencies will allow you to write and execute Arquillian tests using JUnit and provide the necessary components for resolving and managing test dependencies.

## Writing Arquillian Test Cases

Once the project is properly set up, you can start writing your Arquillian test cases. An Arquillian test case is a JUnit test class annotated with `@RunWith(Arquillian.class)`.

```java
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class MyArquillianTest {

    @Deployment
    public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
        // Build and deploy your test archive
    }

    @Test
    public void testArquillian() {
        // Write your test logic here
    }
}
```

In the `createDeployment` method, you can use ShrinkWrap to build and deploy a test archive that contains the necessary resources for your test. This can include classes, library dependencies, configuration files, etc.

## Running Arquillian Tests with Maven

To execute your Arquillian tests using Maven, you can use the `arquillian-maven-plugin`. Add the following plugin configuration to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.14.Final</version>
    <configuration>
        <!-- Specify the target container to run the tests -->
        <container>
            <containerQualifiedName>arquillian-wildfly-remote</containerQualifiedName>
        </container>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>test</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

In the plugin configuration, you specify the target container in which to run the tests. Here, we have used `arquillian-wildfly-remote` as an example, but you can choose any container supported by Arquillian.

Once the configuration is in place, you can run your Arquillian tests using the following Maven command:

```shell
mvn clean test
```

The `arquillian-maven-plugin` will automatically execute your Arquillian test cases within the specified container environment.

## Conclusion

Integrating Arquillian with Maven allows you to easily execute your Arquillian tests as part of your Maven build process. By automating the execution of your tests, you can ensure that your application behaves as expected in a real container environment.
