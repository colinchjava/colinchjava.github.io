In object-oriented programming, **lazy loading** is a design pattern that defers the initialization of an object until it is actually needed. This can help improve performance and optimize resource usage in your Java application. One way to implement lazy loading is by using **dependency injection**.

Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows objects to depend on other objects without creating them directly. It promotes loose coupling and easier testing of code. By combining lazy loading with dependency injection, we can create objects only when they are required, reducing the memory footprint of the application.

Let's see how to implement lazy loading with dependency injection in Java:

## Step 1: Define the interface or abstract class

Start by defining the interface or abstract class that represents the object you want to lazily load. This defines the operations or methods that the object exposes. For example:

```java
public interface Image {
    void display();
}
```
## Step 2: Implement the actual class

Next, create the actual class that implements the interface or extends the abstract class. This class will contain the implementation of the object's behavior. For lazy loading, we'll add a condition to create the object only when it is accessed for the first time. For example:

```java
public class LazyImage implements Image {
    private Image loadedImage;

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (loadedImage == null) {
            loadedImage = loadImage();
        }
        loadedImage.display();
    }

    private Image loadImage() {
        // Perform the actual loading of the image
        // and return the loaded image
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Use dependency injection

To use the lazy loaded object in your code, you can inject it using a dependency injection framework like **Spring** or **Guice**. The framework will handle the creation and initialization of the object for you. For example, in Spring:

```java
@Component
public class ImageService {
    private final Image lazyImage;

    @Autowired
    public ImageService(Image lazyImage) {
        this.lazyImage = lazyImage;
    }

    // Rest of the code
}
```

Here, the `ImageService` class depends on the `Image` object, and Spring will inject an instance of the `LazyImage` class lazily when it is accessed.

## Benefits of Lazy Loading with Dependency Injection

- Improved performance: Objects are created only when actually needed, reducing memory usage and startup time.
- Easier testing: Lazy loading allows for better control over test scenarios by loading objects only when necessary.
- Loose coupling: Dependency injection decouples the usage of an object from its creation, promoting modular and maintainable code.

Implementing lazy loading with dependency injection in Java can help optimize your application's performance and resource usage. By deferring the creation of objects until they are actually needed, you can improve overall efficiency. Consider using this approach when working on projects that require optimizing memory usage or startup time.
