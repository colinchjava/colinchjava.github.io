When writing integration tests for our applications using Arquillian, it's important to ensure that we have proper configuration for our data sources. Arquillian provides a flexible way to configure and manage different data sources for our tests, allowing us to test different scenarios with ease.

In this blog post, we will explore how to configure different data sources for Arquillian tests, helping us test various database configurations, such as different database vendors or different schemas.

## Setting up the Arquillian Test Environment

Before we dive into configuring different data sources, let's first set up the Arquillian test environment. Here's a basic example using JUnit and the WildFly container:

```java
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class MyIntegrationTest {

    @Deployment
    public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
        // Create the deployment archive
    }

    @ArquillianResource
    private URL deploymentUrl;

    // Rest of the test methods
}
```

## Configuring Different Data Sources

To configure different data sources, Arquillian utilizes the ShrinkWrap Descriptors mechanism, which allows us to programmatically define the configuration files for our tests.

Let's say we have two different data sources that we want to test: one for a PostgreSQL database and another for a MySQL database. We can create two `DataSource` instances using the appropriate configuration properties and bind them to JNDI names. Here's an example using the `persistence.xml` file:

```java
public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
    WebArchive archive = ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class)
            // Add application classes and other dependencies to the archive

    // Configure PostgreSQL data source
    DataSource postgresDataSource = new DataSourceImpl(
            "postgresqlDS",
            "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase",
            "username", "password");
    archive.addAsWebInfResource(
            new StringAsset(postgresDataSource.getDescriptor()),
            "classes/META-INF/postgresql-ds.xml");

    // Configure MySQL data source
    DataSource mysqlDataSource = new DataSourceImpl(
            "mysqlDS",
            "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase",
            "username", "password");
    archive.addAsWebInfResource(
            new StringAsset(mysqlDataSource.getDescriptor()),
            "classes/META-INF/mysql-ds.xml");

    // Return the created archive
    return archive;
}
```

In the above code snippet, we create two `DataSource` instances - `postgresDataSource` and `mysqlDataSource`, each with their respective configuration properties. We then add these data sources as resources in the `WebArchive`.

## Running Tests with Different Data Sources

With the data sources configured, we can now write our integration tests, utilizing the different data sources based on our requirements. Here's an example test method utilizing the PostgreSQL data source:

```java
@Test
public void testWithPostgreSQLDataSource() {
    // Use the PostgreSQL data source for this test
}
```

Similarly, we can write other test methods and specify the data source to be used.

## Conclusion

Configuring different data sources for Arquillian tests allows us to test our applications against various database configurations. With Arquillian's flexible configuration mechanism, we can easily switch between different data sources, enabling us to test different scenarios with ease.
