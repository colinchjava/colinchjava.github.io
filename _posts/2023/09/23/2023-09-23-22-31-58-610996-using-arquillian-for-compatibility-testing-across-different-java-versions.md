In today's software development landscape, ensuring that your application is compatible across different Java versions is crucial. One popular tool that can help with this task is Arquillian. Arquillian provides a simple way to write integration and functional tests that can be executed on multiple Java platforms.

## What is Arquillian?

Arquillian is an open-source testing platform that allows developers to write and execute automated tests for their Java applications. It provides a container-based approach, which means tests can be run inside containers that mimic the production environment.

## Compatibility Testing with Arquillian

To perform compatibility testing across different Java versions using Arquillian, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Arquillian

First, you need to set up Arquillian in your project. You can do this by adding the necessary dependencies to your build system (e.g., Maven or Gradle). Consult the Arquillian documentation for detailed instructions on how to set up Arquillian for your specific project.

### Step 2: Write Compatibility Tests

Once Arquillian is set up, you can start writing compatibility tests. These tests should exercise your application's critical functionality and ensure that it works correctly across different Java versions.

Here's an example of a compatibility test using Arquillian and JUnit:

```java
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class CompatibilityTest {

    @Deployment
    public static Archive<?> createDeployment() {
        // Create and configure your application deployment here
        // Return the deployment package (e.g., web archive, jar file)
    }

    @Test
    public void testCompatibility() {
        // Write your compatibility test code here, exercising your application's features
        // Assert that everything works correctly
    }
}
```

In this example, the `@RunWith(Arquillian.class)` annotation indicates that Arquillian should handle the test execution. The `@Deployment` annotation is used to define the deployment package for your application. You can configure it according to your project structure.

Within the `testCompatibility` method, you can write specific tests to ensure compatibility across different Java versions. You should exercise different parts of your application and verify that they behave as expected.

### Step 3: Configure Containers

Arquillian supports various containers for test execution, including both local and remote options. You need to configure the containers to match the Java versions you want to test against.

For example, if you want to test against Java 8 and Java 11, you can configure two containers: one with Java 8 and another with Java 11 runtime. Arquillian will execute your tests within these containers, ensuring compatibility.

### Step 4: Run Compatibility Tests

Finally, you can run your compatibility tests using Arquillian. The tests will be executed within the configured containers, enabling you to test your application's compatibility across different Java versions.

Run the tests using your preferred build tool or IDE. The test results will indicate whether your application is compatible with the tested Java versions or not.

## Conclusion

Arquillian provides a powerful solution for compatibility testing across different Java versions. By leveraging its container-based approach, you can write and execute tests that ensure your application functions correctly with various Java runtime environments.

Next time you need to check your application's compatibility, consider utilizing Arquillian to simplify the process and increase confidence in the compatibility of your Java software.
