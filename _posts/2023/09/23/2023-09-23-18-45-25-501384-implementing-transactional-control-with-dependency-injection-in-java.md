In enterprise applications, it is crucial to maintain transactional control to ensure data consistency and integrity. Java provides a powerful concept called **Dependency Injection (DI)**, which allows for loose coupling between components and promotes easy unit testing and maintainability.

With DI, we can easily integrate transaction management into our application. Let's explore how to achieve this using Java's DI frameworks.

## Step 1: Add the required dependencies

First, we need to add the necessary dependencies to our project. For this example, we'll be using **Spring Framework** as our DI framework and **Spring JDBC** for database connectivity. Add the following dependencies to your project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
    <version>${spring.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>${spring.version}</version>
</dependency>
<!-- Add your database specific dependency here -->
```

Make sure to replace `${spring.version}` with the appropriate version of Spring you are using, and add the database-specific dependency for your chosen database engine.

## Step 2: Create the transactional service

Next, let's create a service class that will handle our business logic and database transactions. We'll annotate this class with the `@Transactional` annotation provided by Spring to enable transaction management.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

@Service
@Transactional
public class MyTransactionalService {
    
    private final MyRepository myRepository;
    
    public MyTransactionalService(MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }
    
    // Your business logic methods here
}
```

In the above code, `MyRepository` represents your data access layer that interacts with the database. Make sure to inject it into the service class constructor.

## Step 3: Configure the Spring ApplicationContext

To enable dependency injection and transaction management, we need to configure the Spring ApplicationContext. Create a configuration class and annotate it with `@Configuration` and `@EnableTransactionManagement`.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.EnableTransactionManagement;

@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class AppConfig {
    
    // Additional configurations if needed
    
}
```

## Step 4: Use the transactional service

Now we can use our transactional service in other components of our application. Let's say we have a REST controller class where we can inject and use the `MyTransactionalService`.

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/myresource")
public class MyResourceController {
    
    private final MyTransactionalService myService;
    
    public MyResourceController(MyTransactionalService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }
    
    @GetMapping
    public String doSomethingTransactional() {
        // Call your transactional service methods here
        return myService.doSomething();
    }
    
    // Other controller methods
    
}
```

In the above code, we inject the `MyTransactionalService` into the REST controller using constructor injection. Now, any method calling `myService.doSomething()` will execute within a database transaction.

## Conclusion

By combining Dependency Injection and transaction management, we can easily maintain transactional control in our Java applications. Spring Framework provides powerful tools and annotations to simplify this process, making it easier to manage transactions and ensure data consistency.
