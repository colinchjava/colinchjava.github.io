In modern distributed systems, ensuring data consistency across multiple databases or services is crucial. One way to achieve this is by using distributed transactions. In this article, we will explore how to implement distributed transactions using Dependency Injection (DI) in Java.

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows the separation of responsibilities in an application by removing the dependencies between classes. It allows objects to be created and wired together externally, making the code more flexible and easier to test.

## Why use Dependency Injection for distributed transactions?

Using Dependency Injection can simplify the implementation of distributed transactions by providing a centralized mechanism for managing transactional resources. By injecting the necessary dependencies, we can ensure that all participating resources are part of the same transaction.

## Implementing distributed transactions with Dependency Injection

To implement distributed transactions with Dependency Injection in Java, we can leverage frameworks like Spring or Google Guice. Let's take a look at an example using the Spring framework.

First, we need to configure the necessary beans in our Spring configuration file. We'll define two transactional resources, such as databases, and a transaction manager to handle the coordination of transactions between these resources.

```java
@Configuration
public class TransactionConfig {

    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource1() {
        // Configure the first database connection
        ...
    }

    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource2() {
        // Configure the second database connection
        ...
    }
    
    @Bean
    public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager() {
        // Configure the transaction manager
        ...
    }
}
```

Next, we can define our service class that will use these transactional resources. We can use the `@Transactional` annotation provided by Spring to mark a method as participating in a distributed transaction.

```java
@Service
public class TransactionalService {

    private final DataSource dataSource1;
    private final DataSource dataSource2;

    @Autowired
    public TransactionalService(DataSource dataSource1, DataSource dataSource2) {
        this.dataSource1 = dataSource1;
        this.dataSource2 = dataSource2;
    }

    @Transactional
    public void performDistributedTransaction() {
        // Perform business logic using the transactional resources
        ...
    }
}
```

By using Dependency Injection, we can inject the transactional resources into our service class, allowing it to participate in a distributed transaction. The `@Transactional` annotation ensures that the transactional boundaries are properly managed by the transaction manager.

## Conclusion

Implementing distributed transactions using Dependency Injection in Java can greatly simplify the management of transactional resources across multiple databases or services. By leveraging frameworks like Spring or Google Guice, we can centralize the transaction handling and ensure data consistency.
