In this blog post, we will explore how to implement compression and decompression functionality in Java using the Dependency Injection design pattern. Compression and decompression are essential techniques for reducing file sizes and improving data transfer efficiency. By implementing these functionalities with Dependency Injection, we can achieve better code organization, reusability, and testability.

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows the separation of an object's creation and its dependencies. It helps to manage complex relationships between objects and promotes loose coupling, making code more maintainable and flexible. In Java, we commonly use frameworks such as Spring or Google Guice to facilitate Dependency Injection.

## Implementing Compression

To implement compression functionality, we will use the Deflater class provided by Java's Standard Library. Let's start by creating an interface `Compressor` that defines the contract for compression operations:

```java
public interface Compressor {
    byte[] compress(byte[] data);
}
```

Next, we can create an implementation of the `Compressor` interface using the Deflater class:

```java
public class DeflaterCompressor implements Compressor {
    @Override
    public byte[] compress(byte[] data) {
        Deflater deflater = new Deflater();
        deflater.setInput(data);
        deflater.finish();

        byte[] compressedData = new byte[data.length];
        int compressedLength = deflater.deflate(compressedData);
        deflater.end();

        return Arrays.copyOf(compressedData, compressedLength);
    }
}
```

## Implementing Decompression

Similarly, we can create an interface `Decompressor` that defines the contract for decompression operations:

```java
public interface Decompressor {
    byte[] decompress(byte[] data);
}
```

Now, let's implement the decompression functionality using the Inflater class:

```java
public class InflaterDecompressor implements Decompressor {
    @Override
    public byte[] decompress(byte[] data) {
        Inflater inflater = new Inflater();
        inflater.setInput(data);

        byte[] decompressedData = new byte[data.length * 2];
        int decompressedLength = inflater.inflate(decompressedData);
        inflater.end();

        return Arrays.copyOf(decompressedData, decompressedLength);
    }
}
```

## Using Dependency Injection

To utilize the compression and decompression functionalities, we can apply Dependency Injection using a framework like Spring or Google Guice. Here, we will demonstrate a simple example using constructor-based injection:

```java
public class CompressionService {
    private final Compressor compressor;
    private final Decompressor decompressor;

    public CompressionService(Compressor compressor, Decompressor decompressor) {
        this.compressor = compressor;
        this.decompressor = decompressor;
    }

    public byte[] compressData(byte[] data) {
        return compressor.compress(data);
    }

    public byte[] decompressData(byte[] compressedData) {
        return decompressor.decompress(compressedData);
    }
}
```

By injecting instances of the `Compressor` and `Decompressor` dependencies into the `CompressionService` class, we can easily switch between different compression and decompression implementations without modifying the service itself.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement compression and decompression functionality in Java using the Dependency Injection design pattern. By separating the compression and decompression logic using interfaces and injecting the implementations, we achieved better code organization, reusability, and testability. Incorporating Dependency Injection into our codebase can improve the overall maintainability and flexibility of our applications.
