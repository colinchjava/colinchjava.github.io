In software development, *Dependency Injection* (DI) is a design pattern that allows objects to receive their dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally. DI promotes loose coupling between components and makes testing and refactoring easier.

While DI is a powerful technique, it is important to understand and avoid common anti-patterns that can creep into your Java codebase. Let's explore some of these anti-patterns and how to mitigate them:

## 1. Constructor Injection Overuse

One common anti-pattern is overusing constructor injection for *optional* dependencies. Constructor injection is best suited for mandatory dependencies, but for optional dependencies, it can lead to a bloated constructor signature.

Instead, consider using *setter injection* or *method injection* for optional dependencies. This way, you can provide default implementations or allow them to be injected later if needed.

## 2. God Object Anti-pattern

The *God Object* anti-pattern occurs when a single class has a large number of dependencies, making it difficult to understand and maintain. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and leads to tightly coupled code.

To mitigate this anti-pattern, apply the *Single Responsibility Principle* and split the responsibilities of the class into smaller, cohesive units. Use DI to inject only the necessary dependencies into each unit, promoting modularity and maintainability.

## 3. Dependency Resolution in Business Logic

Avoid performing dependency resolution or service location directly in your business logic. This violates the *Inversion of Control* principle, making your code tightly coupled to specific implementation details and complicating testing.

Instead, delegate the responsibility of dependency resolution to a dedicated DI framework or container. This allows for easier configuration and ensures that dependencies are resolved consistently across your application.

By understanding and mitigating these dependency injection anti-patterns, you can write cleaner, more modular, and maintainable Java code. Remember to use DI judiciously and consider the overall design and architecture of your application.
