## Introduction
In distributed systems, concurrent access to shared resources can lead to data inconsistencies and race conditions. To overcome these issues, distributed locking is a commonly used mechanism. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement distributed locking with dependency injection in Java, using the popular Spring framework.

## What is Distributed Locking?
Distributed locking ensures that a resource can only be accessed by a single process or thread at a time, even in a distributed and concurrent environment. It provides a way to synchronize access to shared resources, preventing conflicts and maintaining data consistency.

## Implementing Distributed Locking with Dependency Injection
To begin, we need to set up the necessary components for distributed locking in Java. We will use Spring's `@Lock` annotation along with the `LockRegistry` interface provided by the Spring Integration package. 

First, let's define the interface for our distributed lock:

```java
public interface DistributedLock {
    void acquireLock(String lockKey);
    void releaseLock(String lockKey);
}
```

Next, we can implement the `DistributedLock` interface using the Spring integration package:

```java
import org.springframework.integration.support.locks.LockRegistry;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class DistributedLockImpl implements DistributedLock {

    private final LockRegistry lockRegistry;

    public DistributedLockImpl(LockRegistry lockRegistry) {
        this.lockRegistry = lockRegistry;
    }

    public void acquireLock(String lockKey) {
        java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock lock = lockRegistry.obtain(lockKey);
        lock.lock();
    }

    public void releaseLock(String lockKey) {
        java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock lock = lockRegistry.obtain(lockKey);
        if (lock != null && lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

We annotate the implementation class with `@Component` to make it eligible for dependency injection.

## Using Distributed Locking in Your Application
Once the distributed lock component is implemented, we can inject it into any class that requires locking.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyService {

    private final DistributedLock distributedLock;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(DistributedLock distributedLock) {
        this.distributedLock = distributedLock;
    }

    public void performCriticalSection() {
        distributedLock.acquireLock("myLockKey");
        try {
            // Perform critical section operations here
        } finally {
            distributedLock.releaseLock("myLockKey");
        }
    }
}
```

In the `MyService` class, we inject the `DistributedLock` component and use it to acquire and release locks around the critical section of code.

## Conclusion
Implementing distributed locking with dependency injection in Java provides an effective way to synchronize access to shared resources in a distributed system. The example above demonstrates how to use Spring integration components to achieve this.

By using distributed locking, you can ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions, making your application more robust and scalable.
