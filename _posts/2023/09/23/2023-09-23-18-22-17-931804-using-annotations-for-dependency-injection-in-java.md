In Java, Dependency Injection (DI) is a powerful technique used to manage dependencies between classes and promote modularity and reusable code. Traditionally, DI was achieved by using XML configuration files or manual wiring of dependencies. However, with the introduction of annotations in Java, dependency injection has become much easier and cleaner to implement.

## What are Annotations?

Annotations are metadata that can be added to classes, methods, variables, or other program elements in Java. They provide additional information or instructions to the compiler or runtime environment. 

In the context of dependency injection, annotations are used to mark classes or fields that require dependency injection. By using annotations, you can specify which implementation should be injected without the need for extensive XML configuration files.

## Using @Inject Annotation

Java Dependency Injection frameworks, such as Spring and Google Guice, provide the `@Inject` annotation for marking which dependencies should be injected. 

Consider the following example:

```java
public class UserService {
    @Inject
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    // ...
}
```

In this example, the `@Inject` annotation is used to specify that the `userRepository` dependency should be injected by the DI framework. The framework will then take care of instantiating and providing the appropriate implementation of the `UserRepository` interface.

## Configuring Dependency Injection

To enable dependency injection using annotations, you need to configure the DI framework accordingly. This usually involves setting up a configuration class or XML file where you define the rules for dependency injection.

For example, using Spring Framework, you can create a configuration class like this:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public UserService userService() {
        return new UserService();
    }

    @Bean
    public UserRepository userRepository() {
        return new UserRepositoryImpl();
    }

    // ...
}
```

In this configuration class, the `@Bean` annotation is used to define beans that will be managed by Spring's DI container. By default, Spring will look for annotated classes and wire the dependencies based on the `@Inject` or other relevant annotations.

## Benefits of Annotations for Dependency Injection

Using annotations for dependency injection offers several benefits:

1. **Cleaner code**: Annotations reduce the boilerplate code required for manual dependency wiring, resulting in cleaner and more concise code.
2. **Compile-time error checking**: Annotations enable the compiler to catch errors related to dependency injection, such as missing dependencies or incorrect types.
3. **Improved maintainability**: With annotations, the code becomes more self-explanatory and easier to understand, making it easier to maintain and modify in the future.
4. **Flexibility**: Annotations provide flexibility by allowing you to easily switch between different implementations of dependencies without modifying the code.
