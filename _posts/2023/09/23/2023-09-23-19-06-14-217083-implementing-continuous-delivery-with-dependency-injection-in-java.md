Continuous Delivery is a software development practice where teams frequently deliver quality software to production in an automated and predictable manner. One important aspect of Continuous Delivery is ensuring that our code is easily maintainable and testable. A helpful technique to achieve this is by using Dependency Injection (DI) in our Java applications.

## Understanding Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows the separation of concerns in our application by removing the responsibility of creating dependencies from a class. Instead, dependencies are "injected" into the class by an external entity, usually a framework or container.

By using DI, we can easily replace dependencies with mock objects during testing, which helps us write reliable and unit-testable code. Additionally, DI makes it easier to manage complexity and maintainability as our application grows.

## Setting up a Dependency Injection Framework

There are several DI frameworks available for Java, such as Spring Framework, Google Guice, and Dagger. In this example, we will use Spring Framework to demonstrate how to implement DI for continuous delivery.

### Step 1: Configure Spring Dependencies

Add the necessary Spring dependencies to your project's build file (e.g., Maven or Gradle). For Maven, add the following lines to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.9</version>
</dependency>
```

### Step 2: Define Dependencies

Create your application's dependencies as separate classes or components. For example, let's say we have a `UserService` class that depends on a `UserRepository`. We can define these as follows:

```java
public interface UserRepository {
    User findUserById(String id);
}

public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
    // rest of the code
}
```

### Step 3: Configure Spring DI

Create a configuration file (e.g., `application-context.xml` or `ApplicationConfig.java`) to define your beans and their dependencies. Here's an example using XML configuration:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="userRepository" class="com.example.UserRepositoryImpl" />

    <bean id="userService" class="com.example.UserService">
        <constructor-arg ref="userRepository" />
    </bean>

</beans>
```

### Step 4: Use DI in the Application

Now, you can use the DI framework to automatically wire your dependencies. For example, in a main class, you can get an instance of the `UserService` from the Spring container:

```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("application-context.xml");
        UserService userService = context.getBean(UserService.class);
        // use the userService instance
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing Dependency Injection in Java applications helps improve code maintainability, testability, and flexibility. By leveraging a DI framework like Spring, we can easily manage and inject dependencies, making our code suitable for continuous delivery. Choosing the right DI framework for your project is essential, so evaluate various options based on your requirements, community support, and learning curve.
