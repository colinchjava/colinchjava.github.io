Authentication and authorization are crucial aspects of any secure application. In Java, we can implement these functionalities using the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern. DI allows us to decouple the authentication and authorization logic from the business logic of our application, making it more modular and maintainable.

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows the separation of object creation and their dependencies. Instead of creating dependencies within a class, they are injected from the outside, which promotes loose coupling between components.

## Implementing Authentication

To implement authentication in Java using DI, we can create an `AuthenticationService` interface. This interface will define a method for validating user credentials.

```java
public interface AuthenticationService {
    boolean authenticate(String username, String password);
}
```

Next, we can create an implementation of the `AuthenticationService` interface, such as `DatabaseAuthenticationService`, which validates user credentials against a database.

```java
public class DatabaseAuthenticationService implements AuthenticationService {
    public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        // Check the database for the provided username and password
        // Return true if the authentication succeeds, false otherwise
    }
}
```

## Implementing Authorization

Authorization determines whether a user has the necessary permissions to perform a certain action. To implement authorization using DI, we can create an `AuthorizationService` interface, defining a method to check if a user has the required permissions.

```java
public interface AuthorizationService {
    boolean authorize(String username, String action);
}
```

We can then create an implementation of the `AuthorizationService` interface, such as `RoleBasedAuthorizationService`, which checks the user's role against the required permissions.

```java
public class RoleBasedAuthorizationService implements AuthorizationService {
    public boolean authorize(String username, String action) {
        // Retrieve the user's role from the database
        // Check if the user's role has the necessary permission for the action
        // Return true if the authorization succeeds, false otherwise
    }
}
```

## Wiring Up with Dependency Injection

To wire up the authentication and authorization services with DI, we can use a DI framework like Spring or Google Guice. These frameworks handle the creation and injection of dependencies automatically.

Using Spring as an example, we can define the authentication and authorization services as beans in our application context configuration file.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public AuthenticationService authenticationService() {
        return new DatabaseAuthenticationService();
    }

    @Bean
    public AuthorizationService authorizationService() {
        return new RoleBasedAuthorizationService();
    }
}
```

In our application classes that require authentication or authorization, we can then declare the services as dependencies and have them injected by the DI framework.

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    private final AuthenticationService authenticationService;
    private final AuthorizationService authorizationService;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(AuthenticationService authenticationService, AuthorizationService authorizationService) {
        this.authenticationService = authenticationService;
        this.authorizationService = authorizationService;
    }

    // Use the authentication and authorization services in the business logic
}
```

By using DI, we can easily switch between different authentication and authorization implementations by just modifying the configuration. This flexibility allows us to adapt our application to changing requirements without extensive code modifications.
