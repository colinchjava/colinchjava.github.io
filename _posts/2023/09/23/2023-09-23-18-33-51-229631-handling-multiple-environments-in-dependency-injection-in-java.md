In modern Java applications, Dependency Injection (DI) plays a crucial role in making code more modular and testable. One common challenge developers face when using DI is managing different environments such as development, testing, and production. Each environment may require different implementations of certain dependencies or configurations.

## The Problem

Let's consider a scenario where we have different implementations for a `Logger` dependency, depending on the environment. In development, we might want to use a console logger, while in production, we might choose to use a file logger. How can we handle this dynamically in our DI container?

## Solution: Using Conditional Annotations

One possible solution is to utilize **conditional annotations** available in popular DI frameworks like Spring or CDI. Conditional annotations allow us to apply certain conditions on the injection of dependencies based on environment-specific properties.

Let's see an example using Spring Boot:

1. Define a base `Logger` interface:

```java
public interface Logger {
    void log(String message);
}
```

2. Implement different `Logger` implementations for each environment:

```java
@Component
@Profile("development")
public class ConsoleLogger implements Logger {
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Console Logger: " + message);
    }
}

@Component
@Profile("production")
public class FileLogger implements Logger {
    public void log(String message) {
        // code to log to a file
    }
}
```

3. Configure the active profiles in your application properties file:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=development
```

4. Inject the `Logger` dependency wherever needed:

```java
@Component
public class MyClass {
    private final Logger logger;

    public MyClass(Logger logger) {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        logger.log("Doing something...");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Logger` dependency is conditionally injected based on the active profile set in the application properties. If the active profile is "development", the `ConsoleLogger` implementation will be injected. If it is "production", the `FileLogger` implementation will be injected.

## Conclusion

Handling multiple environments in Dependency Injection is a common challenge faced by Java developers. By utilizing conditional annotations in popular DI frameworks like Spring or CDI, we can easily switch between different implementations based on the active environment. This enables us to maintain a modular and configurable codebase that can adapt to various deployment scenarios.
