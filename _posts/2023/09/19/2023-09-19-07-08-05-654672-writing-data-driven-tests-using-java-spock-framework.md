If you are looking for a powerful and expressive framework to write data-driven tests in Java, look no further than the Spock framework. Spock is a testing and specification framework that combines the best features of popular testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito.

In this blog post, we will explore how to write data-driven tests using Spock framework and leverage its data-driven testing capabilities. Let's get started!

### Getting Started with Spock

First, make sure you have Spock added as a dependency in your project's build file. You can use Maven or Gradle to include the Spock dependency:

**Maven:**

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.spockframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>spock-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.0-M2-groovy-2.5</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**

```groovy
testImplementation 'org.spockframework:spock-core:2.0-M2-groovy-2.5'
```

### Writing Data-Driven Tests

To write a data-driven test in Spock, you can use the `@Unroll` annotation along with the `where` block. This allows you to specify the different inputs and expected outputs for your test cases.

Here's an example where we want to test a simple calculator class's `add` method:

```groovy
import spock.lang.Specification
import spock.lang.Unroll

class CalculatorSpec extends Specification {

    @Unroll
    def "Adding #a and #b should equal #expectedResult"(int a, int b, int expectedResult) {
        given:
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator()

        when:
        int result = calculator.add(a, b)

        then:
        result == expectedResult

        where:
        a | b | expectedResult
        2 | 3 | 5
        5 | 7 | 12
        10 | 0 | 10
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `@Unroll` annotation tells Spock to unroll the test cases and show individual results in the test report. The `where` block defines the inputs and expected outputs for each test case.

### Running Data-Driven Tests

To run the data-driven test, you can simply run the test class like any other JUnit test class. The output will show individual results for each test case.

### Conclusion

Spock framework provides a clean and expressive way to write data-driven tests in Java. By leveraging the `@Unroll` annotation and the `where` block, you can easily define multiple test cases with different inputs and expected outputs.

Using data-driven testing allows you to validate your code against various scenarios efficiently and effectively. This can help catch edge cases and ensure the robustness of your code.

So, go ahead and give Spock framework a try for writing data-driven tests in Java. Happy testing!
