Apache Wicket is a popular Java web framework that simplifies the development of web applications. One common requirement in web applications is the ability to download files. In this blog post, I will explain how to implement file download functionality in Apache Wicket.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following dependencies added to your Apache Wicket project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>9.3.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-request</artifactId>
    <version>9.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Creating a DownloadPage

To implement file download functionality, we will start by creating a new Wicket `WebPage` called `DownloadPage`. This page will handle the file download request and stream the file back to the user.

```java
public class DownloadPage extends WebPage {

    public DownloadPage(final IModel<File> fileModel) {
        IResourceStream resourceStream = new FileResourceStream(fileModel.getObject());
        String fileName = fileModel.getObject().getName();
        
        getRequestCycle().scheduleRequestHandlerAfterCurrent(
                new ResourceStreamRequestHandler(resourceStream)
                .setFileName(fileName));
    }
}
```

In the constructor of `DownloadPage`, we create a `FileResourceStream` based on the file model provided. We also extract the file name from the `File` object.

Next, we use `ResourceStreamRequestHandler` to handle the file download request. We set the `fileName` using the extracted file name and schedule the `ResourceStreamRequestHandler` to be executed after the current request cycle.

## Setting up the File Download Link

To trigger the file download, we need to create a link in another page or component. Here's an example of how to create a file download link using `BookmarkablePageLink`:

```java
public class HomePage extends WebPage {

    public HomePage() {
        IModel<File> fileModel = Model.of(new File("/path/to/my/file.txt"));
        
        BookmarkablePageLink<Void> downloadLink = new BookmarkablePageLink<>("downloadLink", DownloadPage.class, fileModel);
        add(downloadLink);
    }
}
```

In the `HomePage` class, we create a `BookmarkablePageLink` called `downloadLink`, which points to the `DownloadPage` and passes the `fileModel` as a parameter.

## Conclusion

With just a few lines of code, we were able to implement file download functionality in Apache Wicket. The `DownloadPage` handles the file download request and the `BookmarkablePageLink` triggers the download from another page or component.

Now, you can integrate file downloading into your Apache Wicket web applications with ease. Happy coding!
