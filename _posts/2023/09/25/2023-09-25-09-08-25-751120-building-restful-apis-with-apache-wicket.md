Apache Wicket is a powerful framework for building web applications in Java. While it is primarily used for creating server-side rendered UIs, it can also be leveraged to build RESTful APIs. In this blog post, we will explore how to build RESTful APIs with Apache Wicket.

## What is a RESTful API?

A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods to interact with resources. It follows a set of principles, including using unique URLs for each resource and utilizing standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on those resources.

## Setting up Apache Wicket for building RESTful APIs

To get started with Apache Wicket, you need to set up a Wicket project. You can do this by creating a new Maven or Gradle project and adding the necessary dependencies. For this example, we will use Maven.

1. Create a new Maven project using your favorite IDE or by running the following command in the terminal:

```java
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.wicket -DarchetypeArtifactId=wicket-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=9.8.0 -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-wicket-api
```

2. Once the project is created, open the `pom.xml` file and add the following dependencies:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
        <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
        <version>9.8.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
        <artifactId>wicket-auth-roles</artifactId>
        <version>9.8.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Add any other dependencies your API might need -->
</dependencies>
```

## Creating a RESTful API using Apache Wicket

Once you have set up your project, you can start building your RESTful API using Apache Wicket. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Create a new package called `api` to hold your API-related classes.

2. Create a new class called `ApiApplication` that extends `WicketApplication`. In this class, you can configure your API's settings and mount the REST resources. For example:

```java
package com.example.mywicketapi.api;

import org.apache.wicket.Application;
import org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WebApplication;

public class ApiApplication extends WebApplication {
    @Override
    protected void init() {
        super.init();
        
        // Mount your REST resources
        mount(new ResourceReferenceMounter("/users", UserResource.class));
    }

    @Override
    public Class<? extends Page> getHomePage() {
        return null;
    }

    public static ApiApplication get() {
        return (ApiApplication) Application.get();
    }
}
```

3. Create your REST resource classes that extend `Resource` or `AbstractResource`. These classes will handle the implementation of your API's endpoints. For example, a `UserResource` class that handles user-related operations:

```java
package com.example.mywicketapi.api;

import org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage;
import org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WebApplication;
import org.apache.wicket.request.mapper.parameter.PageParameters;
import org.apache.wicket.request.resource.IResource;
import org.apache.wicket.request.resource.ResourceReference;

public class UserResource extends AbstractResource {
    @Override
    protected ResourceResponse newResourceResponse(Attributes attributes) {
        ResourceResponse response = new ResourceResponse();
        
        // Handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests here
        
        return response;
    }
}
```

4. Finally, start your Apache Wicket server by running the `main` method in the `ApiApplication` class. You can use an embedded container or deploy your application to a servlet container like Tomcat.

## Conclusion

Apache Wicket provides a robust framework for building RESTful APIs in Java. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can create powerful and scalable APIs using Apache Wicket. So go ahead, give it a try, and start building your RESTful API with Apache Wicket today!
