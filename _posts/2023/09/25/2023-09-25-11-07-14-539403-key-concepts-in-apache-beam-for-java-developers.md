1. PCollection: 

The fundamental data abstraction in Apache Beam is the PCollection, which represents a distributed collection of data elements. PCollection can contain any type of data, such as strings, integers, or custom objects. It represents the input and output of each transform in the data processing pipeline. Developers can apply various transforms, such as filtering, mapping, aggregating, or grouping, on PCollections to process and transform data.

Example code in Java:
```java
   PCollection<String> lines = pipeline.apply(TextIO.read().from("input.txt"));
   PCollection<String> filteredLines = lines.apply(Filter.by(line -> line.contains("important")));
```

2. Transformations: 

Transformations are the building blocks of Apache Beam pipelines. They define how data should be processed and transformed. There are two types of transformations in Apache Beam: PTransforms and ParDo.

- PTransforms: A PTransform represents a processing step that transforms one or more input PCollections into one or more output PCollections. Examples of PTransforms include filtering, mapping, grouping, and aggregating operations.

Example code in Java:
```java
   PCollection<String> lines = pipeline.apply(TextIO.read().from("input.txt"));
   PCollection<Integer> lineLengths = lines.apply(MapElements.into(TypeDescriptors.integers())
                                      .via(line -> line.length()));
```

- ParDo: ParDo is a more flexible transformation that allows developers to apply custom processing logic to each element in a PCollection. It can be used for tasks like filtering, parsing, or enriching data elements.

Example code in Java:
```java
   PCollection<String> lines = pipeline.apply(TextIO.read().from("input.txt"));
   PCollection<String> words = lines.apply(ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, String>() {
       @ProcessElement
       public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
           String line = c.element();
           String[] splitWords = line.split(" ");
           for (String word: splitWords) {
               c.output(word);
           }
       }
   }));
```

By understanding these key concepts in Apache Beam, Java developers can effectively build and execute data processing pipelines that can handle large-scale batch and streaming data processing tasks. Leveraging the power and flexibility of Apache Beam allows developers to write data processing logic once and run it on different execution engines without changing the code.
