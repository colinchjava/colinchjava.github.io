Multi-tenancy is a software architecture pattern that allows a single application to serve multiple customers or tenants, each with their own isolated data and configuration. In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement multi-tenancy in Apache Wicket applications.

### What is Apache Wicket?

Apache Wicket is an open-source Java web framework that simplifies the development of dynamic web applications. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a component-based development model.

### Why Multi-tenancy?

Multi-tenancy is crucial for software applications that serve multiple clients or organizations. It allows for better resource utilization, scalability, and security. By implementing multi-tenancy in Apache Wicket applications, you can serve multiple tenants with a single codebase, while keeping their data and configuration separate.

### The Multi-Tenancy Approach

To implement multi-tenancy in Apache Wicket applications, you can follow these steps:

1. **Tenant Identification**: Identify the tenant for each incoming request. This could be done based on the URL, domain, or any other custom identification mechanism.

2. **Tenant Context**: Create a tenant context object that holds the information related to the current tenant, such as database connection details and configuration.

3. **Request Filtering**: Intercept incoming requests and extract the tenant identifier. Set the tenant context based on the identifier.

4. **Database Isolation**: Ensure that data for each tenant is stored in separate databases or schemas. This ensures data isolation between tenants.

5. **Tenant-specific Configuration**: Provide a way to configure tenant-specific settings. This could be achieved through configuration files or a configuration database.

### Example Code

The following example code demonstrates how to implement multi-tenancy in an Apache Wicket application. 

```java
public class TenantContext {
    private static ThreadLocal<Tenant> currentTenant = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public static void setCurrentTenant(Tenant tenant) {
        currentTenant.set(tenant);
    }

    public static Tenant getCurrentTenant() {
        return currentTenant.get();
    }
}

public class MultiTenantRequestCycleListener extends AbstractRequestCycleListener {
    @Override
    public void onBeginRequest(RequestCycle cycle) {
        // Extract the tenant identifier from the request and set the tenant context
        String tenantIdentifier = extractTenantIdentifier(cycle.getRequest());
        Tenant tenant = findTenantByIdentifier(tenantIdentifier);
        TenantContext.setCurrentTenant(tenant);
    }

    @Override
    public void onEndRequest(RequestCycle cycle) {
        // Clear the tenant context at the end of the request
        TenantContext.setCurrentTenant(null);
    }
}

// Configuration in Wicket Application class
@Override
protected void init() {
    super.init();
    getRequestCycleListeners().add(new MultiTenantRequestCycleListener());
}
```

### Conclusion

Implementing multi-tenancy in Apache Wicket applications allows you to serve multiple tenants with a single codebase while keeping their data and configuration separate. By following the steps mentioned above and using the example code provided, you can introduce multi-tenancy in your applications effectively. Enjoy building scalable and secure applications with Apache Wicket!
