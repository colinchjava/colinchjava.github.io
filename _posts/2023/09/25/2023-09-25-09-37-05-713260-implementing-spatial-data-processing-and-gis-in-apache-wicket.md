## Step 1: Add GIS libraries to your project

The first step is to add the necessary GIS libraries to your Apache Wicket project. There are several open-source libraries available that provide spatial data processing and GIS functionalities. Two popular options are:

1. **GeoTools**: A Java library that provides tools for manipulating and processing geospatial data. It supports a wide range of geographic data formats and can perform operations like spatial analysis and map rendering.

```java
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.geotools</groupId>
    <artifactId>gt-main</artifactId>
    <version>XX.XX</version>
</dependency>
```

2. **JTS (Java Topology Suite)**: A Java library that provides a set of spatial data structures and algorithms. It forms the foundation for many GIS applications and allows you to perform operations like geometrical calculations and spatial analysis.

```java
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.locationtech.jts</groupId>
    <artifactId>jts-core</artifactId>
    <version>XX.XX</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure to update the version numbers to the latest stable releases.

## Step 2: Implement spatial data processing logic

Once you have added the required libraries, you can start implementing spatial data processing logic in your Apache Wicket application. This can include tasks like loading and parsing geographic data files, performing spatial queries, and generating maps or visualizations.

```java
import org.geotools.data.simple.SimpleFeatureCollection;
import org.geotools.data.simple.SimpleFeatureIterator;
import org.geotools.data.shapefile.ShapefileDataStore;
import org.opengis.feature.simple.SimpleFeature;

public class SpatialDataProcessor {
    
    public void processSpatialData(String shapefilePath) {
        try (ShapefileDataStore dataStore = new ShapefileDataStore(new File(shapefilePath).toURI().toURL())) {
            String typeName = dataStore.getTypeNames()[0];
            SimpleFeatureCollection featureCollection = dataStore.getFeatureSource(typeName).getFeatures();
            SimpleFeatureIterator featureIterator = featureCollection.features();
            
            while (featureIterator.hasNext()) {
                SimpleFeature feature = featureIterator.next();
                // Process each feature and perform spatial operations
            }
            
            featureIterator.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle exception
        }
    }
    
    // Other spatial data processing methods
}
```

## Step 3: Integrate GIS functionality into your Apache Wicket application

Next, you need to integrate the GIS functionality into your Apache Wicket application's user interface. This can involve displaying spatial data on maps, allowing users to interact with the maps, and performing spatial queries or analysis based on user inputs.

One way to achieve this is by using map libraries such as OpenLayers or Leaflet. These libraries provide powerful map rendering capabilities and support interactions like panning, zooming, and selecting features. You can embed the map component in your Apache Wicket application's web pages using the appropriate Wicket components or custom code.

```java
public class MapPage extends WebPage {

    public MapPage() {
        // Initialize map component
        MapComponent map = new MapComponent("map");
        add(map);
    }
    
    // Other page logic
}
```

```html
<html>
<body>
    <div wicket:id="map"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can incorporate spatial data processing and GIS functionalities into your Apache Wicket applications. This enables you to build web applications that leverage the power of spatial analysis and visualization, opening up possibilities for various geospatial use cases. Remember to choose the appropriate GIS libraries and ensure proper integration with your Apache Wicket project. Happy spatial coding!
