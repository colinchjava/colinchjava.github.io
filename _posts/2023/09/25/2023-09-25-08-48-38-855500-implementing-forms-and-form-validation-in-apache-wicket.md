Apache Wicket is a powerful Java web framework that simplifies the development of web applications. One common task in web development is handling forms and performing form validation. In this blog post, we will learn how to implement forms and form validation in Apache Wicket.

## Creating a Form

To create a form in Apache Wicket, we first need to create a `Form` component. This component acts as a container for the form fields and handles the form submission. Here's an example of creating a simple form:

```java
public class MyForm extends Form<Void> {

    public MyForm(String id) {
        super(id);

        add(new TextField<>("name", Model.of("")));
        add(new TextField<>("email", Model.of("")));
        add(new Button("submit"));
    }

    @Override
    protected void onSubmit() {
        // Handle form submission
    }
}
```

In the example above, we create a form called `MyForm` which extends the `Form` class. Inside the constructor, we add form fields (text fields in this case) and a submit button using the `add()` method. We also override the `onSubmit()` method to handle the form submission.

## Adding Form Validation

Apache Wicket provides built-in support for form validation. We can easily add validation rules to form fields using validators. Let's see an example of adding form validation to our previous form:

```java
public class MyForm extends Form<Void> {

    public MyForm(String id) {
        super(id);

        TextField<String> nameField = new TextField<>("name", Model.of(""));
        nameField.setRequired(true);
        add(nameField);

        TextField<String> emailField = new TextField<>("email", Model.of(""));
        emailField.add(EmailAddressValidator.getInstance());
        add(emailField);

        add(new Button("submit"));
    }

    @Override
    protected void onSubmit() {
        // Handle form submission
    }
}
```

In the updated form, we set the `required` property of the `nameField` to `true` to make it a required field. We also add the `EmailAddressValidator` to the `emailField` to ensure it contains a valid email address. Apache Wicket provides various built-in validators for common validation scenarios.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement forms and form validation in Apache Wicket. We saw how to create a form using the `Form` component and add form fields and a submit button. We also explored how to add form validation using validators. Apache Wicket makes it easy to handle forms and perform form validation, allowing developers to focus on building robust web applications.
