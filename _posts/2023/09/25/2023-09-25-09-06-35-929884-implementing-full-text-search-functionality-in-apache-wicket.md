Apache Wicket is a popular Java web framework known for its component-based architecture and ease of use. However, it doesn't provide built-in support for full-text search functionality out of the box. In this blog post, we'll explore how to implement full-text search in an Apache Wicket application.

## Why Full-Text Search?

Full-text search allows users to search through large amounts of text data quickly and efficiently. It enables features like auto-suggestions, fuzzy matching, and advanced search filters. By implementing full-text search, you can enhance the search capabilities of your application, making it more user-friendly and powerful.

## Apache Lucene - The Go-To Library

To implement full-text search functionality in Apache Wicket, we can rely on Apache Lucene, an open-source search engine library. Lucene provides powerful indexing and querying capabilities, making it a perfect fit for implementing search features.

To get started, we need to add the Lucene dependency in our project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.lucene</groupId>
    <artifactId>lucene-core</artifactId>
    <version>8.10.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Once we have the dependency set up, we can begin integrating Lucene into our Apache Wicket application.

## Creating a Search Index

The first step is to create an index for our searchable data. The index is a data structure that will allow us to perform efficient searches. We will need to define which fields we want to include in the search index.

Let's say we have a `Book` class with fields like `title`, `author`, and `description`. To create a search index for books, we need to:

1. Instantiate a `Directory` object, which represents the storage for the index. We can use `FSDirectory` to store the index on the filesystem.
2. Create an `Analyzer` object to specify how the text should be processed during indexing and searching. The `StandardAnalyzer` is a good choice for general-purpose text indexing.
3. Use a `IndexWriterConfig` to configure the `IndexWriter` that will create and update the index.
4. Iterate over the books and add them to the search index by creating `Document` objects and adding relevant fields.
5. Finally, close the `IndexWriter` to ensure the index is persisted properly.

Here's an example code snippet to illustrate the process:

```java
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer;
import org.apache.lucene.document.Document;
import org.apache.lucene.document.Field;
import org.apache.lucene.document.TextField;
import org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter;
import org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriterConfig;
import org.apache.lucene.store.Directory;
import org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory;

public class BookIndexer {

    public void createIndex() {
        Directory directory = FSDirectory.open(Paths.get("/path/to/index/directory"));
        Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();

        IndexWriterConfig config = new IndexWriterConfig(analyzer);
        IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(directory, config);

        List<Book> books = bookService.getAllBooks();

        for (Book book : books) {
            Document doc = new Document();
            doc.add(new TextField("title", book.getTitle(), Field.Store.YES));
            doc.add(new TextField("author", book.getAuthor(), Field.Store.YES));
            doc.add(new TextField("description", book.getDescription(), Field.Store.YES));
            writer.addDocument(doc);
        }

        writer.close();
    }
}
```

## Performing Searches

Now that we have created the search index, we can perform searches based on user queries. The process involves:

1. Creating a `Directory` object pointing to the index location.
2. Creating an `IndexReader` from the directory.
3. Creating an `IndexSearcher` from the `IndexReader`.
4. Building a `Query` object representing the user's search query.
5. Executing the query using the `IndexSearcher` and extracting the matched documents.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the search process:

```java
import org.apache.lucene.queryparser.classic.MultiFieldQueryParser;
import org.apache.lucene.queryparser.classic.ParseException;
import org.apache.lucene.queryparser.classic.QueryParser;
import org.apache.lucene.search.*;

public class BookSearcher {

    public List<Book> searchBooks(String queryText) {
        Directory directory = FSDirectory.open(Paths.get("/path/to/index/directory"));
        IndexReader reader = DirectoryReader.open(directory);
        IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(reader);

        String[] searchFields = {"title", "author", "description"};
        QueryParser parser = new MultiFieldQueryParser(searchFields, new StandardAnalyzer());
        Query query;

        try {
            query = parser.parse(queryText);
        } catch (ParseException e) {
            // Handle parsing exception
            e.printStackTrace();
            return Collections.emptyList();
        }

        int numResults = 10;
        TopDocs topDocs;

        try {
            topDocs = searcher.search(query, numResults);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle search exception
            e.printStackTrace();
            return Collections.emptyList();
        }

        List<Book> searchResults = new ArrayList<>();

        for (ScoreDoc scoreDoc : topDocs.scoreDocs) {
            Document doc = searcher.doc(scoreDoc.doc);
            String title = doc.get("title");
            String author = doc.get("author");
            String description = doc.get("description");
            // Create a book object and add it to the search results list
            searchResults.add(new Book(title, author, description));
        }

        return searchResults;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

By integrating Apache Lucene into our Apache Wicket application, we can empower our users with powerful full-text search functionality. With Lucene's indexing and querying capabilities, we can enable fast and accurate searches over large amounts of textual data. Implementing full-text search can significantly enhance the user experience and make our application more competitive in the market.
