In today's data-driven world, **clean and normalized data** is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making. One powerful tool for performing data cleansing and normalization is the Apache Beam Java SDK. With its robust features and flexibility, Apache Beam allows you to process large datasets in a distributed and scalable manner.

## What is Data Cleansing?

Data cleansing is the process of **detecting and correcting or removing** corrupt, inaccurate, or irrelevant records from a dataset. It involves various operations such as fixing typos, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistent formatting. The goal is to transform raw, messy data into a clean and consistent form that is suitable for analysis.

## What is Data Normalization?

Data normalization is the process of **structuring and organizing** data in a consistent and standardized format. It involves transforming data into a common representation that eliminates redundancy and improves efficiency. Normalization helps in reducing data anomalies, improving data integrity, and enabling efficient querying and analysis.

## Performing Data Cleansing and Normalization with Apache Beam Java SDK

Apache Beam provides a concise and powerful programming model for processing data in a parallel and distributed manner. Let's explore how we can leverage Apache Beam Java SDK for data cleansing and normalization.

### Step 1: Setting up Apache Beam Java SDK

To get started, you need to set up the Apache Beam Java SDK. You can include the necessary dependencies in your Maven or Gradle project, or download the SDK from the official Apache Beam website.

### Step 2: Reading and Processing Data

The first step is to read the input data from a source such as a file, database, or streaming source. Apache Beam provides built-in connectors for various data sources, allowing you to easily ingest data.

```java
PipelineOptions options = PipelineOptionsFactory.create();
Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create(options);

PCollection<String> input = pipeline.apply(TextIO.read().from("input.txt"));

// Perform data cleansing and normalization operations

pipeline.run().waitUntilFinish();
```

### Step 3: Performing Data Cleansing and Normalization

Now that we have the input data, we can apply various data cleansing and normalization operations using Apache Beam's transform functions.

**Example 1: Removing Duplicates**

```java
PCollection<String> uniqueData = input.apply(Distinct.<String>create());
```

**Example 2: Handling Missing Values**

```java
PCollection<String> cleanedData = input.apply(ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, String>() {
  @ProcessElement
  public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
    String data = c.element();
    if (!data.isEmpty()) {
      c.output(data);
    }
  }
}));
```

**Example 3: Fixing Typos**

```java
PCollection<String> normalizedData = input.apply(ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, String>() {
  @ProcessElement
  public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
    String data = c.element();
    // Perform typo correction operations
    String normalized = data.replaceAll("typos", "corrected");
    c.output(normalized);
  }
}));
```

### Step 4: Writing Output Data

Finally, we can write the cleansed and normalized data to a destination of our choice, such as a file or a database.

```java
cleanedData.apply(TextIO.write().to("output.txt"));
```

## Conclusion

Data cleansing and normalization are essential steps in data processing and analysis. Apache Beam Java SDK provides a powerful and scalable platform for performing these tasks efficiently. With its flexible programming model, you can easily apply various data transformation operations to clean and normalize your datasets.
