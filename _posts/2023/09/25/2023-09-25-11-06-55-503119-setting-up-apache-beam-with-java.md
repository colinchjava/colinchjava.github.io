Apache Beam is an open-source unified programming model designed for processing large-scale data sets. It offers a high-level API that allows you to write expressive and portable data processing pipelines. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of setting up Apache Beam with Java.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- Apache Maven
- Apache Beam SDK for Java

## Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
Visit the Oracle website and download the latest version of the JDK compatible with your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided by Oracle. Once the installation is complete, you can verify that Java is installed by opening a terminal window and running the following command:

```shell
java -version
```

You should see the installed Java version in the output.

## Step 2: Install Apache Maven
Apache Maven is a popular build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It helps manage project dependencies and build processes. You can download the latest stable version of Maven from the Apache Maven website. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

To verify that Maven is installed, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```shell
mvn -version
```

You should see the Maven version and other details in the output.

## Step 3: Setup Apache Beam SDK for Java
To start using Apache Beam with Java, you need to include the Apache Beam SDK as a dependency in your project. 

1. Create a new Maven project:

```shell
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.beam \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=beam-sdks-java-maven-archetypes-examples \
  -DarchetypeVersion=2.30.0
```

2. Change directory to the newly created project:

```shell
cd <your-project-directory>
```

3. Import the project into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ or Eclipse.

4. Open the `pom.xml` file in your project and add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.beam</groupId>
  <artifactId>beam-sdks-java-io-google-cloud-platform</artifactId>
  <version>2.30.0</version>
</dependency>
```

This dependency allows you to work with Google Cloud Platform services using Apache Beam.

5. Build your project:

```shell
mvn install
```

This will download the Apache Beam SDK for Java and its dependencies.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Apache Beam with Java. Now you can start developing your data processing pipelines using the powerful features provided by Apache Beam.
