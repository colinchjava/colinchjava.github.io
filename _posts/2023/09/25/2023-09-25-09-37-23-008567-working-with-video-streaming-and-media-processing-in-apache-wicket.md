Apache Wicket is a powerful Java web framework that allows developers to build dynamic web applications. While it primarily focuses on server-side rendering, it also offers capabilities for working with video streaming and media processing.

## Streaming Video with Apache Wicket

To stream videos in Apache Wicket, you can take advantage of the HTML5 `<video>` element and the built-in media support. Here's an example of how you can use Apache Wicket to stream a video file:

```java
public class VideoPage extends WebPage {
    
    public VideoPage(final PageParameters parameters) {
        super(parameters);
        
        File videoFile = new File("/path/to/video.mp4");
        IResource videoResource = new FileResourceStreamResource(videoFile).setCacheable(false);
        
        MediaComponent video = new MediaComponent("video", videoResource);
        
        add(video);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `MediaComponent` named "video" and pass it a `FileResourceStreamResource` that points to the video file. By setting `setCacheable(false)`, we ensure that the video is not cached by the browser, allowing for efficient streaming.

## Media Processing with Apache Wicket

Apart from streaming video, Apache Wicket also provides features for media processing. For example, you can use Apache Wicket's `Image` component to dynamically manipulate and process images on the fly.

```java
public class ImagePage extends WebPage {

    public ImagePage(final PageParameters parameters) {
        super(parameters);

        File imageFile = new File("/path/to/image.jpg");
        IResource imageResource = new FileResourceStreamResource(imageFile);

        Image image = new Image("image", imageResource);
        image.setOutputMarkupId(true);

        add(image);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we load an image file using `FileResourceStreamResource` and create an `Image` component. The `Image` component can be further manipulated or processed before being rendered on the web page.

## Conclusion

Apache Wicket is not just limited to server-side rendering; it also offers multimedia capabilities, making it a versatile framework for developing web applications that work with video streaming and media processing. By incorporating these features into your Apache Wicket project, you can create dynamic and engaging web applications that handle multimedia content effortlessly.
