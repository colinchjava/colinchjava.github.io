In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a simple web application using Apache Wicket, a popular Java web framework for building a rich and responsive user interface. Apache Wicket follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, making it easy to develop and maintain web applications.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- Apache Maven
- Your favorite IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse)

## Step 1: Set Up a Maven Project
First, let's start by setting up a Maven project for our web application. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:
```shell
mvn archetype:generate -B -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=mywebapp -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.wicket \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=wicket-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=9.4.0-M6 -DinteractiveMode=false
```

This command will generate a Maven project structure with the necessary dependencies and configuration files.

## Step 2: Create a Home Page
Open your IDE and navigate to the `src/main/java/com/example` directory. Create a new Java class called `HomePage.java` and add the following code:

```java
import org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage;
import org.apache.wicket.markup.html.basic.Label;

public class HomePage extends WebPage {
    public HomePage() {
        add(new Label("message", "Welcome to my web application!"));
    }
}
```

This code creates a `HomePage` class that extends `WebPage`. It adds a `Label` component with the message "Welcome to my web application!".

## Step 3: Configure Application Initialization
Next, open `src/main/java/com/example` directory and create a new Java class called `WicketApplication.java`. Add the following code:

```java
import org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage;
import org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WebApplication;

public class WicketApplication extends WebApplication {
    @Override
    public Class<? extends WebPage> getHomePage() {
        return HomePage.class;
    }
}
```

This code creates a `WicketApplication` class that extends `WebApplication`. It overrides the `getHomePage()` method to specify that the home page of our application is the `HomePage` class.

## Step 4: Build and Run the Application
Now, let's build and run our web application! Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory. Execute the following command:
```shell
mvn clean install
```

After the build has finished successfully, run the application using the following command:
```shell
mvn jetty:run
```

You can now visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and see the home page of your web application.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully created a simple web application using Apache Wicket. You can further explore the capabilities of Apache Wicket and start building more complex and feature-rich applications.
