## Data Validation Techniques

### 1. Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a commonly used technique to ensure that data follows a specific pattern or format. Apache Beam Java provides the `ParDo` transform, which can be used to apply pattern matching on each element in a `PCollection`. You can use regular expressions to define the pattern to match against. For example:

```java
PCollection<String> inputData = ...; // Input PCollection of data

PCollection<String> validatedData = inputData.apply(
    ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, String>() {
        @ProcessElement
        public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
            String data = c.element();
            // Apply pattern matching to validate the data
            if (data.matches("[A-Za-z0-9]+")) {
                c.output(data);
            }
        }
    })
);
```

In the above example, the `ParDo` transform applies pattern matching using a regular expression to validate each element in the input PCollection. Only elements that match the specified pattern are outputted to the `validatedData` PCollection.

### 2. Range Validation

Range validation ensures that data falls within a specific range of values. Apache Beam Java provides the `Filter` transform, which can be used to filter out elements that do not meet the range criteria. For example, let's say we want to validate that a numeric value is between 1 and 10:

```java
PCollection<Integer> numericData = ...; // Input PCollection of numeric data

PCollection<Integer> validatedData = numericData.apply(
    Filter.greaterThanOrEqualTo(1).and(Filter.lessThanOrEqualTo(10))
);
```

In the above example, the `Filter` transform is used to keep only the elements that fall within the specified range of 1 to 10.

## Data Cleansing Techniques

### 1. Removing Duplicates

Duplicates in data can cause issues in downstream processing and analysis. Apache Beam Java provides the `Distinct` transform, which can be used to remove duplicates from a `PCollection`. For example:

```java
PCollection<String> inputData = ...; // Input PCollection of data

PCollection<String> deduplicatedData = inputData.apply(Distinct.create());
```

In the above example, the `Distinct` transform is applied to the input PCollection to remove any duplicate elements, resulting in the `deduplicatedData` PCollection.

### 2. Handling Missing Values

Missing values are common in real-world datasets and need to be handled before further processing. Apache Beam Java provides the `Filter` transform, which can be used to remove missing values from a `PCollection` based on specific criteria. For example, to remove elements containing `null` values:

```java
PCollection<String> inputData = ...; // Input PCollection of data

PCollection<String> cleanedData = inputData.apply(
    Filter.<String>fn((String value) -> value != null)
);
```

In the above example, the `Filter` transform is used to keep only the elements that are not `null`, effectively removing any missing values from the `inputData` PCollection.

These are some of the commonly used data validation and cleansing techniques in Apache Beam Java. By leveraging the power of Apache Beam's transforms, you can ensure that your data pipeline processes clean and valid data, leading to more accurate and reliable results.
