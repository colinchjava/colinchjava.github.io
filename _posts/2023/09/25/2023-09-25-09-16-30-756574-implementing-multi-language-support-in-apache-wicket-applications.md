In today's globalized world, it is essential for web applications to support multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base. Apache Wicket, a popular Java web framework, provides built-in support for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n), making it relatively straightforward to implement multi-language support in your applications.

## Step 1: Enable resource bundle localization in your project

The first step in adding multi-language support to your Apache Wicket application is to enable resource bundle localization. Resource bundles allow you to store localized text for different languages in separate properties files. This separation of language-specific text from the application code greatly simplifies the process of translations.

To enable resource bundle localization, add the following configuration line to your `Application` class:

```java
@Override
protected void init() {
    super.init();
    getResourceSettings().addResourceBundle("messages");
}
```

This code snippet tells Apache Wicket to look for a properties file named `messages.properties` in your classpath for localized messages.

## Step 2: Create properties files for each supported language

Next, create properties files for each language you want to support. These files should be named following the pattern `messages_<locale>.properties`, where `<locale>` represents the ISO language code for the target language.

For example, to support English (`en`) and French (`fr`), you would create the following properties files:

- `messages_en.properties`
- `messages_fr.properties`

Inside each properties file, you define key-value pairs where the key represents the symbolic name for a specific text element and the value contains the translated text for that element. For example:

`messages_en.properties`:

```
greeting=Hello!
welcome=Welcome to our application.
```

`messages_fr.properties`:

```
greeting=Bonjour!
welcome=Bienvenue dans notre application.
```

## Step 3: Retrieve localized messages in your Wicket components

Once you have defined your resource bundles for each supported language, you can start using the localized messages in your Wicket components.

To retrieve a localized message, you can use the `getString(key)` method provided by the `Component` class. For example, to display a localized greeting message, you can do the following:

```java
public class HomePage extends WebPage {

    public HomePage() {
        add(new Label("greeting", getString("greeting")));
    }
}
```

In this example, the `getString("greeting")` method retrieves the localized greeting based on the user's language preference.

## Step 4: Switching between languages

To enable users to switch between languages, you can add a language selector component to your application's UI. This component can be a dropdown or a set of buttons that allows users to choose their desired language.

When a user selects a different language, you can store the selected language preference in the user's session or in a cookie. Then, you can programmatically change the user's locale to the selected language by calling `Session#setLocale(locale)`.

```java
public class LanguageSelector extends Panel {

    public LanguageSelector(String id) {
        // Initialize your language selector component here
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onComponentTag(ComponentTag tag) {
        super.onComponentTag(tag);
        
        // Add an event listener to update the user's locale when the language selection changes
        tag.put("onchange", "Wicket.Ajax.get({u: '?lang=' + this.value})");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `onComponentTag()` method adds an `onchange` event listener to the language selector component. When the user selects a different language, an Ajax request is sent to the server, including the selected language in the URL parameter `lang`. On the server side, you can update the user's locale based on the received language value.

## Conclusion

Adding multi-language support to your Apache Wicket applications is made easy with its built-in internationalization and localization features. By following these steps, you can provide a user-friendly experience for users speaking different languages and help your application reach a wider audience.
