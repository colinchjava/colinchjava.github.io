## Setting Up the Project
Before we begin, make sure you have Apache Wicket set up in your project. To add Apache Wicket to your Maven project, include the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>8.12.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Once you have your project set up, let's move on to implementing the file upload functionality.

## Creating the File Upload Page
To create a page with file upload functionality, follow these steps:

1. Create a new class that extends `org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage`.
2. In the constructor of the page, add a form component and set the form's enctype attribute to `"multipart/form-data"`. This is required for file uploads.
3. Add a `FileUploadField` to the form. This component will handle the file upload.
4. Add a submit button to the form.
5. Override the `onSubmit()` method to handle the file upload logic.

Here's an example of how the page class may look like:

```java
public class FileUploadPage extends WebPage {

    public FileUploadPage() {
        Form<?> form = new Form<>("uploadForm");
        form.setMultiPart(true); // Set the form's enctype to "multipart/form-data"
        
        FileUploadField fileUploadField = new FileUploadField("fileUpload");
        form.add(fileUploadField);
        
        form.add(new SubmitLink("submit") {
            @Override
            public void onSubmit() {
                FileUpload uploadedFile = fileUploadField.getFileUpload();
                
                if (uploadedFile != null) {
                    // Handle the uploaded file
                    // You can save it to disk or process it in any way you want
                }
            }
        });
        
        add(form);
    }
}
```

## Making the File Upload Page Accessible
To make the file upload page accessible in your application, you need to mount it to a URL. You can do this by adding the following code in your `WebApplication` class:

```java
@Override
protected void init() {
    super.init();
    mountPage("/upload", FileUploadPage.class);
}
```

Now you can access the file upload page by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/upload` in your browser.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we have learned how to implement file upload functionality in Apache Wicket using the `FileUploadField` component. With this knowledge, you can now add file upload capabilities to your Apache Wicket web application. Happy coding!
