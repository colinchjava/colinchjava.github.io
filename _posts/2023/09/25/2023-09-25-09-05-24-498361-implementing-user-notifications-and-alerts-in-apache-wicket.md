## Setting up the Wicket project

Before we dive into implementing user notifications and alerts, let's set up a basic Wicket project. You can create a new Maven project using the following command:

```shell
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.wicket -DarchetypeArtifactId=wicket-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=9.0.0-M8
```

This command will generate a new Wicket project with the appropriate structure and dependencies.

## Implementing user notifications

User notifications are typically displayed as temporary messages at the top or bottom of a web page. They can be used to provide feedback on successful actions, errors, or any other important information.

In Apache Wicket, we can leverage the `FeedbackPanel` component to implement user notifications. The `FeedbackPanel` is a container that automatically displays any feedback messages added to it. Let's see an example:

```java
public class HomePage extends WebPage {
    
    public HomePage() {
        FeedbackPanel feedbackPanel = new FeedbackPanel("feedback");
        add(feedbackPanel);
        
        // Displaying a success message
        feedbackPanel.info("Success!");
        
        // Displaying an error message
        feedbackPanel.error("Oops, something went wrong!");
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create a `FeedbackPanel` component and add it to the web page. We then use the `info` and `error` methods to add success and error messages, respectively.

## Displaying user alerts

User alerts are often used to notify users about important information or actions that require their immediate attention. They are typically displayed as non-dismissible messages that overlay the current page.

Apache Wicket doesn't provide a built-in component for alerts, but we can easily implement them using JavaScript libraries like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [SweetAlert](https://sweetalert.js.org/).

Let's take an example of implementing user alerts using Bootstrap:

1. Include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your project.
   
2. Create an `AlertPanel` component that extends `Panel`:

    ```java
    public class AlertPanel extends Panel {
    
        public AlertPanel(String id, String message, String cssClass) {
            super(id);
            
            add(new Label("message", message));
            
            // Add the CSS class dynamically
            add(new AttributeAppender("class", cssClass));
        }
    }
    ```
   
3. Use the `AlertPanel` component in your web page:

    ```java
    public class HomePage extends WebPage {
    
        public HomePage() {
            // Displaying a success alert
            add(new AlertPanel("alert", "Success!", "alert-success"));
            
            // Displaying an error alert
            add(new AlertPanel("alert", "Oops, something went wrong!", "alert-danger"));
        }
    }
    ```

In the above code, we create an `AlertPanel` component that takes a `message` and `cssClass` as parameters. We use the `Label` component to display the message and the `AttributeAppender` to add the CSS class dynamically.

By integrating Bootstrap alerts, we can easily create user alerts that provide an intuitive and visually appealing way to notify users.

## Conclusion

Implementing user notifications and alerts is an essential aspect of modern web applications. In this blog post, we explored how to implement user notifications using the `FeedbackPanel` component in Apache Wicket. We also learned how to create user alerts using JavaScript libraries like Bootstrap.

By effectively implementing user notifications and alerts, we can enhance the user experience and keep users informed about important events or updates within the application.
