## Internationalization (i18n)

Internationalization, often referred to as i18n (since there are 18 letters between the 'i' and 'n'), is the process of designing and implementing an application in a way that makes it easy to support multiple languages. It involves separating the text and user interface elements from the code, so that they can be easily translated into different languages without modifying the application's logic.

Apache Wicket provides comprehensive support for internationalization out of the box. It allows you to externalize text and messages into resource bundles, which are files containing localized versions of the texts used in your application. Resource bundles can be created for different languages and regions, such as English, French, German, etc.

To internationalize your Apache Wicket application, you can start by creating a properties file for each locale. For example, you may create a file named `messages.properties` for the default locale (usually English) and additional files like `messages_fr.properties` for French, `messages_de.properties` for German, and so on. In each file, you define key-value pairs where the keys represent the identifiers used in the code and the values represent the localized texts.

To use these resource bundles in your application, you can access the localized texts by using the `getString` method provided by the `Component` class. This method takes a key as a parameter and returns the corresponding localized text. For example:

```java
Label helloLabel = new Label("hello", getString("hello"));
```

In this example, the `hello` key is used to retrieve the localized text from the resource bundle, and the resulting value is set as the label's text.

## Localization (l10n)

Localization, often referred to as l10n (since there are 10 letters between the 'l' and 'n'), is the process of adapting an application to a specific locale by translating and customizing various aspects of the user interface to fit the target culture and language.

With Apache Wicket, you can easily localize different aspects of your application, such as date and time formats, number formats, currency symbols, and more. Apache Wicket uses the `java.util.Locale` class to represent locales, which encapsulate information about a specific geographic, cultural, or linguistic region.

To support localization in Apache Wicket, you can set the desired locale for your application. This can be done using the `Session` object:

```java
getSession().setLocale(Locale.FRENCH);
```

By setting the desired locale, Apache Wicket will automatically apply the appropriate localization settings, such as date and number formats, based on the selected locale. This ensures that your application presents information in a way that is familiar to the target audience.

In addition to the built-in localization support, Apache Wicket also provides features like automatic right-to-left (RTL) text rendering for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, making it easier to create applications that cater to a global user base.

In conclusion, Apache Wicket offers robust internationalization and localization features that simplify the process of building applications for a global audience. By leveraging resource bundles and localization settings, developers can create applications that are easily translatable and adaptable to different languages and cultural norms.
