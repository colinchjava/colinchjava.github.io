Apache Beam is a powerful framework for building big data processing pipelines. One of the key features of Apache Beam is its ability to work with multiple data sources and process them in a unified manner. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with multiple data sources in Apache Beam Java pipelines.

## Setting up the Data Sources

Before we dive into the code, let's first set up the data sources. In this example, we will be working with two different data sources: a CSV file and a remote database.

### CSV Data Source

To work with a CSV file, we need to define a `CsvIO` transformation. Here's how you can set up a CSV data source:

```java
PCollection<String> csvData = pipeline.apply(CsvIO.read()
    .from("gs://my-bucket/data.csv")
    .withHeader(true)
    .withDelimiter(",")
    .withQuote("\"")
    .withSkipHeaderLines(1));
```

In the above code, we use the `CsvIO.read()` method to configure the CSV data source. We specify the input file path, whether the file has a header, the delimiter, quote character, and the number of header lines to skip.

### Database Data Source

To work with a remote database, we can use the JDBC connector provided by Apache Beam. Here's how you can set up a database data source:

```java
PCollection<String> jdbcData = pipeline.apply(JdbcIO.<String>read()
    .withDataSourceConfiguration(JdbcIO.DataSourceConfiguration
        .create("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver", "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb")
        .withUsername("username")
        .withPassword("password"))
    .withQuery("SELECT * FROM table"));
```

In the above code, we use the `JdbcIO.read()` method to configure the JDBC data source. We specify the driver class, database connection URL, username, password, and the SQL query to fetch the data.

## Processing the Data

Once you have set up the data sources, you can process them using the various transformations and operations provided by Apache Beam. Here's an example of processing the data using a simple `ParDo` transformation:

```java
PCollection<String> processedData = PCollectionList.of(csvData).and(jdbcData)
    .apply(Flatten.pCollections()) // Combine multiple collections into one
    .apply(ParDo.of(new DoFn<String, String>() {
        @ProcessElement
        public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
            // Process each element
            String data = c.element();
            // TODO: Add your processing logic here
            c.output(data);
        }
    }));
```

In the above code, we use `PCollectionList.of()` to combine both the CSV data and JDBC data into a single collection. Then, we apply a `ParDo` transformation to process each element of the collection. Inside the `processElement` method, you can add your custom processing logic.

## Conclusion

Working with multiple data sources in Apache Beam Java pipelines is a powerful feature that allows you to process diverse data in a unified manner. Whether you are working with CSV files, databases, or other data sources, Apache Beam provides a flexible and scalable framework to handle your data processing needs.
