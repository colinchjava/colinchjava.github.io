GlassFish is an open-source application server that supports JavaEE (Java Enterprise Edition) applications. It provides a platform for developing and deploying enterprise-level Java applications. In this blog post, we will explore how GlassFish can be used in conjunction with JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.3 to develop robust and scalable Java applications.

## JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.3

JSF is a Java-based web application framework that simplifies the development of user interfaces for Java applications. With JSF, developers can create dynamic and interactive web pages using reusable UI components and event-driven programming. JSF 2.3, the latest version of JSF, introduces several new features and enhancements to improve developer productivity and application performance.

Some of the key features in JSF 2.3 include:

- **Improved resource handling**: JSF 2.3 provides better handling of static resources such as CSS and JavaScript files, making it easier to manage and serve these files in web applications.
  
- **HTML5 support**: JSF 2.3 includes enhanced support for HTML5 elements and attributes, allowing developers to build modern and responsive web applications.

- **Client-side validation**: JSF 2.3 introduces client-side validation, reducing the need for server round-trips and improving the responsiveness of web forms.

## Developing with GlassFish and JSF

To start developing Java applications with GlassFish and JSF 2.3, you need to have the following setup:

1. **Install GlassFish**: [Download](https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/download) and install GlassFish on your development machine. GlassFish provides a web-based administration console for managing and configuring your Java applications.

2. **Create a JSF application**: Use your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to create a new Java web project and include the required JSF libraries. Ensure that your project is configured to use GlassFish as the deployment target.

3. **Configure JSF in web.xml**: In your web application's `web.xml` file, configure the JSF servlet and mapping as follows:

```xml
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>FacesServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
  
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>FacesServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/faces/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

4. **Create JSF pages**: Create JSF pages (`.xhtml` files) to define the user interface of your application. Use JSF tags and components to create interactive forms, tables, and other UI elements.

5. **Handle JSF events**: Implement server-side logic by handling JSF events. JSF provides a rich event model to handle user actions, form submissions, and other events.

6. **Deploy and run the application**: Build and deploy your project to GlassFish, either through your IDE or by manually packaging it as a WAR (Web Archive) file. Start GlassFish and access your application through a web browser.

That's it! You are now ready to develop Java applications using GlassFish and JSF 2.3. Take advantage of the powerful features and flexibility provided by GlassFish and JSF to build robust and scalable enterprise applications.
