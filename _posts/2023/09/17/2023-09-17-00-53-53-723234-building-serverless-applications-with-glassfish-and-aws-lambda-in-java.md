In today's fast-paced development world, building serverless applications has become a popular approach. Serverless architecture allows developers to focus on writing code without being concerned about managing servers or infrastructure. In this blog post, we will explore how to build serverless applications in Java using GlassFish and AWS Lambda.

## What is GlassFish?

GlassFish is a Java-based open-source application server that is fully compatible with the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) platform. It provides a runtime environment for deploying and managing Java applications, including web applications, web services, and enterprise applications.

## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With AWS Lambda, you can simply upload your code and the service takes care of running and scaling it.

## Integrating GlassFish with AWS Lambda

To build serverless applications with GlassFish and AWS Lambda, we need to leverage the GlassFish Docker image and AWS Lambda's Java runtime environment.

1. **Create a Spring Boot application:** Start by creating a Spring Boot application using your favorite IDE. Spring Boot provides a simple and lightweight way to develop Java-based applications. Make sure to define your application's dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.

2. **Configure AWS Lambda function:** Create a new AWS Lambda function using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. Specify the runtime as "Java 8" and upload your Spring Boot application's JAR file as the function code.

3. **Build GlassFish Docker image:** Use the GlassFish Docker image to build a containerized version of your application. This can be done by creating a `Dockerfile` and specifying the GlassFish base image and copying your application's artifacts into the container.

   ```docker
   FROM glassfish:latest
   
   COPY target/my-application.war $GLASSFISH_HOME/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy/
   ```

4. **Deploy GlassFish Docker image:** Once the Docker image is built, it can be deployed to AWS Lambda using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. AWS Lambda will take care of running the GlassFish container and scaling it as needed.

   ```bash
   aws lambda create-function --function-name my-glassfish-app --runtime java8 --memory-size 256 \
   --handler com.example.MyHandler::handleRequest --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-execution-role \
   --code S3Bucket=my-spring-boot-app-bucket,S3Key=my-spring-boot-app.jar
   ```

## Conclusion

Building serverless applications with GlassFish and AWS Lambda in Java provides developers with the freedom to focus on writing code rather than managing servers. By leveraging the power of GlassFish's Java EE runtime environment and AWS Lambda's serverless architecture, you can build scalable and efficient applications. Give it a try and experience the benefits of serverless development!
