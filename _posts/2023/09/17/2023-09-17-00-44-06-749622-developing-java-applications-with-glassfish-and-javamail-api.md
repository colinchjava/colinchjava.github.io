GlassFish is an open-source application server that provides a platform to develop and deploy Java EE applications. It offers a wide range of features and tools to make Java application development efficient and straightforward. In conjunction with the GlassFish server, the JavaMail API allows developers to integrate email functionality into their applications seamlessly. Let's take a closer look at how to use GlassFish and the JavaMail API to develop robust Java applications.

## Setting up GlassFish server

1. Download and install the GlassFish server from the official website.
2. Launch the GlassFish server by running the following command in the terminal: `asadmin start-domain`.
3. Open the GlassFish admin console by navigating to `http://localhost:4848` in a web browser.
4. Configure the necessary server settings, including connection pools and JDBC resources, to suit your application requirements.

## Integrating JavaMail API

1. Add the JavaMail API library to your Java project by including the relevant JAR files.
2. Import the required JavaMail classes in your application code:

```java
import javax.mail.*;
import javax.mail.internet.*;
```

3. Configure the email session properties, such as SMTP server details and authentication credentials:

```java
Properties properties = System.getProperties();
properties.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
properties.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true");
properties.put("mail.smtp.host", "your_smtp_host");
properties.put("mail.smtp.port", "your_smtp_port");
properties.put("mail.smtp.user", "your_email");
properties.put("mail.smtp.password", "your_password");
```

4. Create a `Session` object with the specified properties:

```java
Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(properties, null);
```

5. Compose the email message and set the necessary details:

```java
Message message = new MimeMessage(session);
message.setFrom(new InternetAddress("sender_email"));
message.setRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, new InternetAddress("recipient_email"));
message.setSubject("Your email subject");
message.setText("Your email body");
```

6. Send the email using the `Transport` class:

```java
Transport.send(message);
```

## Deploying your Java application on GlassFish

1. Package your Java application into a WAR (Web Application Archive) file.
2. Open the GlassFish admin console and navigate to the "Applications" section.
3. Click on "Deploy" and browse for the generated WAR file.
4. Configure the application-specific settings, such as context path and virtual server, if necessary.
5. Click on "OK" to deploy the application on the GlassFish server.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of GlassFish and the JavaMail API, you can develop Java applications with integrated email functionality. With its robust features and comprehensive toolset, GlassFish provides a reliable platform for developing and deploying Java EE applications. Integrating the JavaMail API allows you to send email notifications, alerts, and other relevant information from within your application. Take advantage of these technologies to enhance your Java applications and provide a seamless experience for your users.
