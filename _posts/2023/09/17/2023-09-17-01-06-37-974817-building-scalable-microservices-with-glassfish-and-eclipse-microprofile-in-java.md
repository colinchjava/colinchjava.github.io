Microservices architecture has become increasingly popular in designing and building modern, scalable applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to build scalable microservices using GlassFish, an open-source Java EE application server, and Eclipse MicroProfile, a set of Java standards for building microservices.

## What are microservices?

Microservices architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services, each running in its own process and communicating through lightweight APIs. This approach allows for better scalability, resiliency, and maintainability compared to traditional monolithic applications.

## Why use GlassFish?

GlassFish is a lightweight, open-source Java EE application server that provides a robust and scalable runtime environment for deploying and running microservices. It supports the latest Java EE specifications and offers features such as clustering, high availability, and monitoring, making it an ideal choice for building scalable microservices.

## Getting started with Eclipse MicroProfile

Eclipse MicroProfile is a project that focuses on providing a set of APIs and specifications for building microservices in Java. It offers features such as RESTful web services, fault tolerance, service discovery, and metrics, which are essential for building scalable and resilient microservices.

To get started with Eclipse MicroProfile, you can create a new Java project in your favorite IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, and add the necessary dependencies to your project's build configuration.

## Example code: Building a scalable microservice

Let's take a look at an example of how to build a scalable microservice using GlassFish and Eclipse MicroProfile.

First, we need to define a resource class that will handle incoming HTTP requests:

```java
package com.example.microservice;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    public Response sayHello() {
        return Response.ok("Hello, world!").build();
    }
}
```

Next, we need to configure the microservice endpoint using the `@ApplicationPath` annotation:

```java
package com.example.microservice;

import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/")
public class MicroserviceApplication extends Application {
}
```

Finally, we can deploy the microservice to GlassFish and access it through the defined endpoint. GlassFish will handle the scaling and load balancing of the microservice as needed.

## Conclusion

Building scalable microservices using GlassFish and Eclipse MicroProfile provides a robust and flexible solution for modern application development. By leveraging the power of Java EE standards and microservices architecture principles, developers can create highly scalable and resilient applications.
