In Java application development, there are two important technologies that allow for distributed computing and communication between different Java applications: Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) and Remote Method Invocation (RMI). Both technologies play a crucial role in enabling communication and interaction between Java applications running on different machines.

## JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface)

JNDI provides a unified interface for accessing different naming and directory services in a networked environment. It allows Java applications to look up and access resources such as databases, messaging systems, and other distributed services.

JNDI works based on a naming convention and a hierarchical structure. Applications can bind objects to a specific name in a JNDI context, and later retrieve them by using that name. This enables applications to locate and access resources without being tightly coupled to their physical location or implementation details.

## RMI (Remote Method Invocation)

RMI allows Java objects to invoke methods on objects residing in remote JVMs (Java Virtual Machines). It provides a transparent and object-oriented way of communicating between Java applications over the network. RMI makes it easy for Java applications to invoke methods on remote objects as if they were invoking methods on local objects.

To integrate JNDI and RMI in Java, you can use the following steps:

1. Register the remote objects: In RMI, remote objects need to be registered with the RMI registry or a naming service. JNDI can be used as the naming service to register and bind the remote objects.

2. Look up remote objects: Using JNDI, Java applications can look up the remote objects by their JNDI names. The JNDI lookup operation retrieves a reference to the remote object, which can then be used to invoke methods.

3. Implement the remote object interface: The remote objects that are to be accessed through RMI need to implement a remote interface. This interface defines the methods that can be invoked remotely.

4. Start the RMI Registry: The RMI registry needs to be started to allow for object registration and lookup. This can be done using the `rmiregistry` command provided by Java.

5. Bind the remote object to JNDI: Once the remote object is implemented and the registry is running, you can bind the remote object to JNDI using its JNDI name. This allows other Java applications to access the remote object through JNDI lookup.

By integrating JNDI and RMI, Java applications can communicate and interact with remote objects seamlessly. This enables building distributed systems that can leverage the power of Java's object-oriented programming model.
