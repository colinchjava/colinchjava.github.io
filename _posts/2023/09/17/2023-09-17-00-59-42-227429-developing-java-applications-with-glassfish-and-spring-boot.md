GlassFish and Spring Boot are two popular frameworks used for developing Java applications. GlassFish is an open-source application server that provides a platform for running Java EE (Enterprise Edition) applications. Spring Boot, on the other hand, is a lightweight framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing a streamlined configuration and deployment process.

In this blog post, we will explore how to develop Java applications using GlassFish and Spring Boot, and how these frameworks can work together to create robust and scalable applications.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Before we start developing Java applications with GlassFish and Spring Boot, we need to set up our development environment. Here are the steps:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) - Before we can develop Java applications, we need to install JDK on our machine. You can download the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Install GlassFish - GlassFish can be downloaded from the official GlassFish website. Once the download is complete, follow the installation instructions to install GlassFish on your machine.

3. Set up Spring Boot - Spring Boot can be easily set up using the Spring Initializr. Visit the [Spring Initializr website](https://start.spring.io/) and select the dependencies you need for your application. Generate the project structure and download the generated zip file.

4. Import Spring Boot project - Extract the downloaded zip file and import the project into your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Integrating GlassFish with Spring Boot

To integrate GlassFish with Spring Boot, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Spring Boot project or open an existing one in your IDE.

2. Add the necessary dependencies - In your project's `pom.xml` file, add the following dependencies:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb-runtime</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax</groupId>
    <artifactId>javaee-web-api</artifactId>
    <version>7.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

3. Configure GlassFish - In your Spring Boot project, create a new class called `GlassFishConfig` and add the following code:

```java
@Configuration
public class GlassFishConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmbeddedServletContainerFactory servletContainer() {
        GlassFishEmbeddedServletContainerFactory factory = new GlassFishEmbeddedServletContainerFactory();
        factory.setPort(8080); // Set the port you want to use
        return factory;
    }
}
```

4. Run the Spring Boot application - Now you can run your Spring Boot application using GlassFish as the embedded servlet container. You can access your application by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Conclusion

Developing Java applications with GlassFish and Spring Boot offers a powerful combination of technologies for building robust and scalable applications. By leveraging GlassFish's application server capabilities and Spring Boot's simplified development process, developers can focus on writing clean and maintainable code.
