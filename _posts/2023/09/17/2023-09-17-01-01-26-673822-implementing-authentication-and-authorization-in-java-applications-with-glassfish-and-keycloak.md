With the increasing need for secure and scalable applications, implementing authentication and authorization has become a crucial aspect of application development. In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate GlassFish, a popular Java application server, with Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution, to provide robust authentication and authorization capabilities to our Java applications.

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- GlassFish server
- Keycloak server

### Step 1: Set up Keycloak Server
1. Start by setting up the Keycloak server. You can download the server from the official Keycloak website and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. Once the server is up and running, open the Keycloak admin console in your web browser.

### Step 2: Create a Realm
1. In the Keycloak admin console, click on the "Add realm" button to create a new realm. A realm is a security and administrative domain where identities and clients are managed.

2. Provide a name for the realm and click on "Create" to create the realm.

### Step 3: Configure Realm Settings
1. Under the "Realm Settings" tab, configure the desired settings for your realm, such as token lifespan, password policies, etc.

2. Take note of the "Realm Name" and "Realm URL" as we will need them later when configuring GlassFish.

### Step 4: Create a Client
1. Inside the created realm, go to the "Clients" tab and click on the "Create" button to add a new client. A client represents an application that uses Keycloak for authentication and authorization.

2. Provide a client ID, select the appropriate client protocol (e.g., OpenID Connect), and save the configuration.

### Step 5: Configure Client Settings
1. Configure the client settings such as Valid Redirect URIs, Base URL, etc., as per your application's requirements.

2. Make sure to enable at least the "Authorization Code" flow and "Bearer-only" options.

### Step 6: Configure GlassFish
1. Start the GlassFish server and open the admin console in your web browser.

2. Navigate to the "Security" section and click on "Realms" to add a new realm.

3. Provide the "Realm Name" and "Realm URL" obtained from Keycloak.

### Step 7: Configure Security Providers
1. Inside GlassFish admin console, go to "Security Providers" and click on "AuthRealm" to configure the authentication realm.

2. Set the "JAAS Context" to `keycloak`.

### Step 8: Deploy Your Application
1. Build and deploy your Java application to the GlassFish server.

2. Make sure to include the necessary Keycloak libraries in your application's dependencies.

### Step 9: Test Authentication and Authorization
1. Test the authentication and authorization setup by accessing your application's login page.

2. Use the credentials of a user created in Keycloak to log in and verify that the authentication and authorization are working correctly.

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated GlassFish with Keycloak to provide authentication and authorization for your Java applications.
