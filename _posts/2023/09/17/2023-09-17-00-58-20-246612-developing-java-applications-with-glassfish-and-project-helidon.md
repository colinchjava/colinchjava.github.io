Java has been a popular programming language for developing enterprise applications for many years. With its robust features and vast ecosystem, it continues to be a top choice for developers. In this blog post, we will explore two powerful technologies for developing Java applications - GlassFish and Project Helidon.

## GlassFish
GlassFish is an open-source application server that is part of the Java EE platform. It provides a runtime environment for deploying Java web applications and offers a wide range of features to support the development and deployment process.

GlassFish offers excellent support for Java EE specifications, making it an ideal choice for developing enterprise applications. It provides features like connection pooling, transaction management, security, and clustering, which are essential for building scalable and reliable applications.

To develop Java applications with GlassFish, you need to have a sound understanding of Java EE specifications and have a compatible development environment set up. GlassFish provides an easy-to-use administration console that allows you to manage your applications and configure various server settings.

## Project Helidon
Project Helidon is a lightweight Java framework for building microservices-based and cloud-native applications. It provides a set of libraries and tools that simplify the development process and enable developers to build scalable and flexible applications.

One of the key features of Project Helidon is its support for reactive programming. It leverages popular reactive programming libraries like Reactive Streams and RxJava to build highly performant and responsive applications. With Project Helidon, you can easily handle concurrent requests and achieve better throughput.

Helidon offers two flavors - Helidon SE and Helidon MP. Helidon SE is a lightweight framework that is designed for building standalone microservices, while Helidon MP provides support for the MicroProfile specification, allowing you to build cloud-native applications that can run on any compatible runtime.

To start developing applications with Helidon, you need Java 11 or later installed on your machine. Helidon provides a command-line tool called Helidon CLI, which you can use to create and manage Helidon projects. It also offers extensive documentation and examples to help you get started quickly.

## Conclusion
GlassFish and Project Helidon are powerful tools that allow Java developers to build scalable, reliable, and cloud-native applications. Whether you are building enterprise applications with GlassFish or microservices with Project Helidon, these technologies provide an excellent foundation for your development needs.

With GlassFish, you have access to a powerful application server that supports Java EE specifications and provides essential features for building enterprise applications. On the other hand, Project Helidon offers a lightweight and flexible framework for developing microservices-based applications with support for reactive programming.

By leveraging these technologies in your Java projects, you can streamline the development process, improve performance, and build applications that can scale with your business needs. Embrace the power of GlassFish and Project Helidon to take your Java application development to the next level.
