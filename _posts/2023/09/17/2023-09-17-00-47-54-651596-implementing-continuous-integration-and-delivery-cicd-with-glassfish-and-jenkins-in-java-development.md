Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) has become an essential practice in modern software development. It allows developers to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that the software is always in a releasable state. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement CI/CD using GlassFish and Jenkins in Java development.

### What is GlassFish?

GlassFish is an open-source application server that provides a platform for developing and deploying Java EE applications. It supports various features such as JavaServer Faces, Java Persistence API, and Enterprise JavaBeans. GlassFish allows developers to deploy and run their applications in a scalable and reliable environment.

### What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is a widely used open-source automation tool that facilitates the CI/CD process. It provides a user-friendly web interface for creating and managing build jobs. Jenkins can be easily integrated with version control systems like Git and Subversion, allowing developers to automate the build and deployment tasks.

Now, let's see how we can set up CI/CD with GlassFish and Jenkins in Java development.

### Prerequisites

- GlassFish server installed on the deployment environment
- Jenkins server set up and running

### Steps to Implement CI/CD with GlassFish and Jenkins

1. **Setting up a Jenkins project**

   - Open Jenkins in your web browser and click on "New Item" to create a new project.
   - Provide a name for your project, choose "Freestyle project," and click "OK."
   - Enter a description for your project (optional).

2. **Configuring the source code repository**

   - Under the "Source Code Management" section, select your version control system (e.g., Git).
   - Enter the repository URL and credentials (if required).
   - Select the branch to build (e.g., master).

3. **Setting up the build triggers**

   - Under the "Build Triggers" section, select the desired trigger (e.g., "Poll SCM" to trigger builds periodically).
   - Configure the schedule or leave it empty for immediate builds on every commit.

4. **Configuring the build steps**

   - Under the "Build" section, click on "Add build step" and select "Execute shell" (for Unix-based systems) or "Execute Windows batch command" (for Windows).
   - Write the necessary scripts to build your Java application, such as compiling the code, running tests, and packaging the application into a WAR file.

5. **Configuring the deployment step**

   - After successful build, you can add a post-build action to deploy the artifact to GlassFish.
   - Click on "Add post-build action" and select "Deploy war/ear to a container."
   - Configure the GlassFish server's credentials and provide the path to the WAR file.

6. **Save the configuration**

   - Click on "Save" to save the Jenkins project's configuration.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up CI/CD with GlassFish and Jenkins for your Java development project. 

### Conclusion

Implementing CI/CD with GlassFish and Jenkins allows developers to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring a more efficient and reliable software development lifecycle. By integrating these tools into your Java development workflow, you can save time and effort while maintaining the quality of your software.
