When it comes to developing Java applications that need to expose RESTful APIs, GlassFish and RESTEasy are two powerful tools to consider. GlassFish is a Java EE application server that provides a robust runtime environment for deploying and running Java applications. RESTEasy is a lightweight framework that simplifies the development of RESTful web services in Java.

In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage GlassFish and RESTEasy to build scalable and efficient Java applications with RESTful APIs.

## Setting up GlassFish

The first step is to download and install GlassFish on your machine. You can visit the [official GlassFish website](https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/) to get the latest version and installation instructions.

Once installed, you can start GlassFish by running the `asadmin start-domain` command in the GlassFish bin directory. This will start the default domain of GlassFish.

## Adding RESTEasy to the project

To use RESTEasy in your Java application, you need to add the RESTEasy dependencies to your project. These dependencies can be added manually or using a dependency management tool like Maven or Gradle.

For Maven, you can add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.resteasy</groupId>
    <artifactId>resteasy-jaxrs</artifactId>
    <version>4.6.0.Final</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.resteasy</groupId>
    <artifactId>resteasy-servlet-initializer</artifactId>
    <version>4.6.0.Final</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

For Gradle, you can add the following dependencies to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-jaxrs:4.6.0.Final'
  implementation 'org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-servlet-initializer:4.6.0.Final'
}
```

After adding the dependencies, you can start building your RESTful API using RESTEasy annotations.

## Creating a RESTful API

To create a RESTful API using RESTEasy, you can start by defining a resource class and annotating its methods with appropriate annotations. Here's an example:

```java
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloWorldResource {

  @GET
  @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
  public String sayHello() {
    return "Hello, world!";
  }
}
```

In the above example, we define a resource class `HelloWorldResource` that handles requests to the `/hello` endpoint. The `@GET` annotation indicates that the method should handle GET requests, and the `@Produces` annotation specifies that the response should be of type `text/plain`.

## Deploying to GlassFish

To deploy your Java application with GlassFish, you can use the GlassFish Admin Console or the `asadmin` command-line tool.

Using the command-line tool, navigate to the GlassFish bin directory and run the following command:

```bash
asadmin deploy /path/to/your/application.war
```

Replace `/path/to/your/application.war` with the actual path to your application's WAR file.

Once deployed, you can access your RESTful API by visiting the appropriate endpoint in your browser or by using tools like cURL or Postman.

## Conclusion

GlassFish and RESTEasy provide a powerful combination for developing scalable and efficient Java applications with RESTful APIs. With the easy setup of GlassFish and the simplicity of RESTEasy annotations, building RESTful APIs becomes a smooth process.

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can start developing Java applications with GlassFish and RESTEasy and unlock the benefits of building RESTful APIs in Java.
