In today's digital world, allowing users to sign in to your application using their social media accounts has become a standard feature. It offers convenience to users and saves them from creating yet another username and password combination. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement social login in Java applications using GlassFish as the application server and OAuth2 as the authentication protocol.

## What is OAuth2?

OAuth2 is an open standard protocol that allows an application to access a user's protected resources on a provider's website, without the need for the user to share their credentials with the application. It enables secure and delegated access to APIs by acting as an intermediary between the application and the provider.

## Getting started

Before we dive into implementing social login, we need to set up a development environment with GlassFish and OAuth2.

### Step 1: Set up GlassFish

1. Download GlassFish from the official website and install it on your machine.
2. Start the GlassFish server.

### Step 2: Register your application with the social media provider

To integrate social login in your Java application, you need to register your application with the social media provider you want to use. This process will grant your application permission to access user data.

1. Go to the developer portal of the social media provider (e.g., Facebook, Google, Twitter).
2. Create a new application and provide the necessary information.
3. Obtain the client ID and client secret for your application.

### Step 3: Add OAuth2 client library to your project

Add the OAuth2 client library to your Java project. There are several libraries available for different social media providers. Choose the appropriate library for the provider you want to integrate with.

### Step 4: Set up the OAuth2 configuration

Configure your Java project with the client ID and client secret obtained in Step 2.

### Step 5: Implement social login functionality

Now, let's write some Java code to implement social login functionality using OAuth2. Below is an example of implementing social login with GlassFish and the Facebook OAuth2 client library.

```java
public class FacebookLogin {

    // Redirect URL after successful login
    private static final String REDIRECT_URL = "http://localhost:8080/login";

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Create an instance of the Facebook OAuth2 client
        FacebookClient facebookClient = new DefaultFacebookClient();

        // Generate the authorization URL
        String authorizationUrl = facebookClient.generateAuthorizationUrl(
                "<client_id>",
                REDIRECT_URL,
                Scope.EMAIL,
                Scope.PUBLIC_PROFILE
        );

        // Redirect the user to the authorization URL
        // Handle the callback after successful login to obtain the access token
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create an instance of the Facebook OAuth2 client and generate the authorization URL. The user will be redirected to this URL to log in to Facebook and grant permission to our application. After successful login, we can obtain the access token to authenticate and authorize further API calls.

## Conclusion

Implementing social login in Java applications using GlassFish and OAuth2 can greatly enhance user experience and reduce the registration friction. By leveraging the OAuth2 protocol and the appropriate client library, you can seamlessly integrate social media authentication in your application.
