In the world of Java enterprise applications, Jakarta EE plays a vital role. It is a set of specifications and standards that define the core functionalities required by enterprise applications. Previously known as Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition), Jakarta EE offers a scalable and secure environment for building robust and enterprise-grade applications.

One of the most popular implementations of Jakarta EE is GlassFish, a lightweight and open-source application server. However, with the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE, many developers are now considering migrating their applications from GlassFish to newer Jakarta EE compatible servers. In this blog post, we will explore the process and benefits of migrating applications from GlassFish to Jakarta EE.

## Why Migrate from GlassFish to Jakarta EE?

### 1. Future Compatibility

Since Jakarta EE is the new standard for Java enterprise applications, migrating from GlassFish to Jakarta EE ensures future compatibility and aligns your applications with the latest industry standards and best practices. It allows you to take advantage of new features and enhancements provided by Jakarta EE.

### 2. Community Support

Another advantage of migrating to Jakarta EE-compatible servers is the strong community support available. As Jakarta EE gains momentum, an increasing number of developers and contributors are actively involved in its development and provide support through forums, documentation, and various open-source projects.

### 3. Ecosystem Expansion

By migrating to Jakarta EE, you can tap into a wider ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that are compatible with Jakarta EE. This expands your options for building and implementing enterprise applications, making it easier to integrate with other platforms and services.

## Migrating from GlassFish to Jakarta EE

Migrating from GlassFish to Jakarta EE involves several steps, including:

### 1. Review Application Dependencies

An essential first step is to review your application's dependencies and make sure they are compatible with Jakarta EE. Jakarta EE has evolved from Java EE and introduced some changes, so it's crucial to ensure that all third-party libraries, frameworks, and custom code are compatible and updated accordingly.

### 2. Jakarta EE Server Selection

After resolving any compatibility issues, you need to choose a Jakarta EE-compatible application server for deploying your application. Some popular choices include Apache TomEE, Payara Server, and WildFly.

### 3. Configuration and Deployment

Next, you need to update your application's configuration files to work seamlessly with the chosen Jakarta EE server. This may involve revisiting the server-specific deployment descriptors, resource configurations, security settings, and any other server-specific configurations.

### 4. Testing and Validation

Once the migration and configuration are complete, thorough testing and validation are crucial. Execute comprehensive tests to ensure that all features and functionality of your application are working as expected on the Jakarta EE server. Pay extra attention to any custom code or specific features that may require modification.

### 5. Performance Optimization

Optimizing your migrated application for performance is an essential step. Jakarta EE servers offer various performance-tuning options and optimizations that can improve the overall performance of your application. Monitor and fine-tune the application to achieve the best possible performance on the chosen Jakarta EE server.

## Conclusion

Migrating from GlassFish to Jakarta EE is a necessary step to align your Java enterprise applications with the latest industry standards and best practices. By migrating, you ensure future compatibility, benefit from community support, and tap into an expanded ecosystem of compatible tools and frameworks. Following the migration steps discussed in this blog post, you can successfully transition your applications to Jakarta EE and take advantage of its powerful features and innovation. #JavaEE #JakartaEE
