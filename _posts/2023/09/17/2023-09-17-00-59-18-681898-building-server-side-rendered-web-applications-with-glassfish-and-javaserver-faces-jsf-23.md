When it comes to building robust and scalable web applications, server-side rendering is still the go-to approach for many developers. In this blog post, we'll explore how GlassFish and JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.3 can be used to build powerful server-side rendered web applications.

## What is GlassFish?

**GlassFish** is a powerful and widely-used open-source application server that provides a Java EE (Enterprise Edition) runtime environment for hosting and running Java applications. It offers support for various Java technologies and specifications, making it an excellent choice for building enterprise-grade web applications.

## What is JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.3?

**JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.3** is a Java-based web application framework that simplifies the development of user interfaces for Java web applications. It follows a component-based model, allowing developers to build reusable UI components and easily manage complex UI layouts.

## Setting up GlassFish and JSF 2.3

To get started with building server-side rendered web applications using GlassFish and JSF 2.3, follow these steps:

1. Download and install GlassFish: Head over to the GlassFish website and download the latest version of the application server. Install it on your local machine.

2. Create a new JSF project: Use your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to create a new Java project. Select the option to create a new JSF project and choose the GlassFish runtime environment.

3. Configure JSF dependencies: Make sure you have the necessary JSF dependencies in your project. This includes the JSF API and implementation libraries. If you are using Maven, update your `pom.xml` file accordingly.

4. Define your UI components: Start building your UI components using JSF tags. JSF provides a rich set of built-in UI components, such as `<h:inputText>`, `<h:commandButton>`, and `<h:dataTable>`, which you can use to create interactive web interfaces.

5. Bind UI components to managed beans: Create managed beans to handle the business logic and bind them to the UI components using JSF's *Expression Language (EL)*. This allows you to seamlessly connect your UI with your backend code.

6. Deploy and run your application: Once you have completed building your web application, deploy it to GlassFish and start the server. You can access your application by navigating to the provided URL.

That's it! You now have a server-side rendered web application built using GlassFish and JSF 2.3.

## Benefits of server-side rendering with GlassFish and JSF 2.3

Server-side rendering offers several benefits for web application development, including:

- **SEO friendliness**: Server-side rendering ensures that search engines can easily crawl and index your web pages, leading to better search engine optimization.

- **Performance**: With server-side rendering, the server generates the HTML for the entire web page, reducing the amount of processing that needs to happen on the client-side.

- **Security**: Server-side rendering prevents exposing sensitive business logic and application code to the client-side, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

- **Code reusability**: JSF's component-based model promotes code reusability, allowing you to build UI components that can be used across different pages and applications.
