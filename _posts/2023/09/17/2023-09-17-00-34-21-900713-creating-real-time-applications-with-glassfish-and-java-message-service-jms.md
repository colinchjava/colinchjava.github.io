In today's fast-paced digital world, real-time applications have become a fundamental requirement for various industries and use cases. From instant messaging to live stock tickers, real-time applications enable users to receive and respond to data in milliseconds.

One powerful tool for building real-time applications is GlassFish, an open-source application server that provides a robust runtime environment for Java applications. In combination with Java Message Service (JMS), GlassFish allows developers to create highly scalable and efficient real-time applications.

## What is JMS?

Java Message Service (JMS) is a Java API that enables applications to exchange messages asynchronously. It provides a common interface for producing and consuming messages, making it easier to integrate applications and systems.

JMS is based on the publish-subscribe and point-to-point messaging models. In the publish-subscribe model, messages are sent to multiple subscribers, while in the point-to-point model, each message is consumed by a single receiver.

## Setting up GlassFish and JMS

To get started with building real-time applications using GlassFish and JMS, follow these steps:

1. Download and install GlassFish: Visit the official GlassFish website (``https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/``) and download the latest stable version of GlassFish for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.

2. Configure JMS resources: After installing GlassFish, you need to configure JMS resources by creating a JMS resource adapter and connection factory. This can be done using the GlassFish administration console, which is accessible through a web browser. Consult the GlassFish documentation for detailed instructions on setting up JMS resources.

3. Develop your application: Now that the necessary resources are set up, you can start building your real-time application. Use your preferred Java IDE and the JMS API to produce and consume messages. Define your message formats, configure message listeners, and handle incoming messages according to your application's requirements.

## Example code

Let's take a look at a simple example that demonstrates how to use JMS with GlassFish to build a real-time chat application:

```java
import javax.jms.*;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;

public class ChatApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Obtain JMS connection factory
            Context context = new InitialContext();
            ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = (ConnectionFactory)context.lookup("jms/ConnectionFactory");

            // Create JMS connection and session
            Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
            Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);

            // Obtain JMS topic
            Topic chatTopic = (Topic)context.lookup("jms/ChatTopic");

            // Create JMS publisher and subscriber
            MessageProducer publisher = session.createProducer(chatTopic);
            MessageConsumer subscriber = session.createConsumer(chatTopic);

            // Start JMS connection
            connection.start();

            // Send and receive messages
            TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage();
            message.setText("Hello, World!");

            publisher.send(message);

            Message receivedMessage = subscriber.receive();
            if (receivedMessage instanceof TextMessage) {
                TextMessage textMessage = (TextMessage)receivedMessage;
                System.out.println("Received message: " + textMessage.getText());
            }

            // Clean up resources
            session.close();
            connection.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

GlassFish and JMS provide a powerful platform for building real-time applications. With its scalability and flexibility, GlassFish enables developers to create high-performance applications that can handle real-time data. By leveraging the JMS API, developers can easily integrate messaging capabilities into their applications, allowing for real-time communication and data exchange.
