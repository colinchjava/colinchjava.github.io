WebSocket has become a popular choice for real-time communication between web clients and servers. However, ensuring the security of WebSocket applications is vital to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. In this blog post, we will explore how to build secure WebSocket applications using GlassFish and the Java Security API (JSR 375).

## Understanding WebSocket security

WebSocket is a protocol that allows for full-duplex communication between a web client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It provides a persistent connection that enables bi-directional communication, making it ideal for applications that require real-time updates.

When it comes to securing WebSocket applications, several considerations need to be taken into account:

1. **Authentication**: Ensuring that only authorized clients can access the WebSocket endpoint.
2. **Authorization**: Controlling the actions that authenticated clients can perform on the WebSocket.
3. **Data encryption**: Protecting the data transmitted over the WebSocket connection to prevent eavesdropping.
4. **Secure configuration**: Configuring the WebSocket server for secure communication.

## Securing WebSocket with GlassFish

GlassFish is an open-source application server that provides a Java EE runtime environment. It supports WebSocket out of the box and offers several features to enhance the security of WebSocket applications.

To secure WebSocket applications with GlassFish, you can leverage the Java Security API (JSR 375), which provides a unified way to handle security-related tasks in Java EE. JSR 375 introduces the concept of security annotations, which can be used to apply security constraints to WebSocket endpoints.

## Securing WebSocket with Java Security API

To secure a WebSocket endpoint using the Java Security API, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Enable security**: Enable security for your WebSocket application in the `web.xml` file by adding the following code:

```xml
<security-constraint>
   <web-resource-collection>
      <web-resource-name>WebSocket</web-resource-name>
      <url-pattern>/websocket/*</url-pattern>
   </web-resource-collection>
   <auth-constraint>
      <role-name>USER</role-name>
   </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>
<login-config>
   <auth-method>FORM</auth-method>
   <form-login-config>
      <form-login-page>/login</form-login-page>
      <form-error-page>/login/error</form-error-page>
   </form-login-config>
</login-config>
```

2. **Configure roles**: Define the roles that will have access to the WebSocket endpoint by adding the following code to the `glassfish-web.xml` file:

```xml
<security-role-mapping>
   <role-name>USER</role-name>
   <group-name>myGroup</group-name>
</security-role-mapping>
```

3. **Apply security constraints**: Apply security constraints to your WebSocket endpoint by adding annotations to the endpoint class:

```java
import javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpoint;
import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;

@ServerEndpoint(value = "/websocket/endpoint")
@RolesAllowed("USER")
public class MyWebSocketEndpoint {
   // WebSocket endpoint implementation
}
```

4. **Access control**: Implement access control logic inside the WebSocket endpoint by injecting the `javax.websocket.EndpointConfig` and using the `getUserPrincipal()` method:

```java
import javax.websocket.OnMessage;
import javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpoint;
import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
import javax.websocket.EndpointConfig;
import java.security.Principal;

@ServerEndpoint(value = "/websocket/endpoint")
@RolesAllowed("USER")
public class MyWebSocketEndpoint {
   @OnMessage
   public void handleMessage(String message, EndpointConfig config) {
      Principal userPrincipal = config.getUserPrincipal();
      if (userPrincipal != null) {
         // Access control logic
      }
   }
}
```

## Conclusion

Securing WebSocket applications is crucial to protect sensitive data and ensure the privacy of communication between web clients and servers. By leveraging GlassFish and the Java Security API (JSR 375), developers can easily implement authentication, authorization, and encryption for their WebSocket applications. Incorporating these security measures is essential for building robust and secure real-time communication solutions.
