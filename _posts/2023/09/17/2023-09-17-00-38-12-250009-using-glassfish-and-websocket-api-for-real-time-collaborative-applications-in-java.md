In today's digital era, real-time collaboration is becoming increasingly crucial for various applications. From collaborative editors to live chat systems, real-time updates and communication play a significant role in delivering a seamless user experience. One way to achieve real-time collaboration in Java is by utilizing the GlassFish server and the WebSocket API.

## What is GlassFish server?

**GlassFish** is a Java-based, open-source server that enables developers to build and deploy Java EE applications. It provides a robust and scalable environment for running Java applications, including support for the WebSocket protocol.

## WebSocket API

The **WebSocket API** is a communication protocol that establishes a full-duplex, bidirectional communication channel between a client and a server. It enables real-time, low-latency data transfer, making it ideal for real-time collaborative applications.

To get started with GlassFish and the WebSocket API, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure GlassFish server on your machine. You can download the latest version from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Create a new Java EE project in your IDE of choice.

3. Include the necessary dependencies for the WebSocket API in your project's `pom.xml` file if you're using Maven or add the JAR files to your project's classpath manually.

4. Create a WebSocket endpoint class by implementing the `javax.websocket.Endpoint` interface. This class will handle incoming WebSocket connections and messages.

```java
import javax.websocket.Endpoint;
import javax.websocket.EndpointConfig;
import javax.websocket.MessageHandler;
import javax.websocket.Session;
import javax.websocket.CloseReason;

public class MyEndpoint extends Endpoint {
    @Override
    public void onOpen(Session session, EndpointConfig config) {
        // Handle new WebSocket connection
        session.addMessageHandler(new MessageHandler.Whole<String>() {
            @Override
            public void onMessage(String message) {
                // Handle incoming messages
                System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public void onClose(Session session, CloseReason reason) {
        // Handle WebSocket connection close
    }
}
```

5. Annotate your WebSocket endpoint class with the `javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpoint` annotation, specifying the URL path where the WebSocket endpoint will be available.

```java
import javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpoint;

@ServerEndpoint("/myendpoint")
public class MyEndpoint {
    // Endpoint implementation goes here
}
```

6. Deploy your application to the GlassFish server. Make sure the server is running and accessible.

7. Client applications can connect to your WebSocket endpoint using the WebSocket API. Here's an example of a JavaScript client:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080/myapp/myendpoint");

socket.onopen = function() {
    console.log("WebSocket connection established.");
};

socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log("Received message: " + event.data);
};

socket.onclose = function() {
    console.log("WebSocket connection closed.");
};

socket.send("Hello, server!");
```

With the GlassFish server and the WebSocket API, you can build powerful real-time collaborative applications in Java. Whether it's a live chat system or a collaborative document editor, the possibilities are endless. Leverage the full-duplex, low-latency communication provided by WebSocket to deliver a seamless user experience.
