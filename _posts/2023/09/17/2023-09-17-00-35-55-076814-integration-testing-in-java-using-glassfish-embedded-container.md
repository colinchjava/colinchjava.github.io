Integration testing is an essential part of software development, where we verify that different components of an application work together as expected. In Java applications, we often rely on application servers or containers to host and run our code. One popular choice is the GlassFish server. In this blog post, we'll explore how to perform integration testing in Java using the GlassFish embedded container.

## What is the GlassFish Embedded Container?

The GlassFish embedded container provides a lightweight way to run and test Java EE applications without the need for a separate server installation. It allows us to deploy and execute our code within the same JVM, enabling faster and more efficient integration tests.

## Setting up the Project

To start with integration testing using the GlassFish embedded container, we need to set up our project correctly. Here are the steps:

1. **Add Dependencies:** Include the necessary libraries in your project's dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. You will need `javax:javaee-api` and `org.glassfish.embedded:embedded-all` dependencies.

2. **Configure the Embedded Container:** Create an instance of the `org.glassfish.embeddable.GlassFish` class to configure and manage the embedded container. For example:

```java
import org.glassfish.embeddable.*;

public class IntegrationTestSetup {
    private GlassFish embeddedServer;

    public void setupContainer() throws Exception {
        embeddedServer = GlassFishRuntime.bootstrap().newGlassFish();
        embeddedServer.start();
    }

    public void tearDownContainer() throws Exception {
        embeddedServer.stop();
        embeddedServer.dispose();
    }
}
```
    
3. **Deploy the Application:** Use the `embeddedServer` instance to deploy your application. You can provide the path to your application's WAR file or use a Maven plugin to build and package your application on-the-fly.

```java
embeddedServer.getDeployer().deploy(new File("<path-to-war-file>"));
```

4. **Perform Integration Tests:** With the container set up and the application deployed, you can now write integration tests using frameworks like JUnit or TestNG. Here's an example:

```java
import org.junit.*;
import javax.annotation.Resource;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;

public class MyIntegrationTest extends IntegrationTestSetup {

    @Test
    public void testSomeFeature() {
        // Given
        // Set up test data or dependencies
        
        // When
        // Execute the feature or functionality to be tested
        
        // Then
        // Perform assertions to validate the expected behavior
        
        // Cleanup
        // Remove test data or dependencies
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Integration testing helps ensure that our Java applications function as expected when different components interact. By using the GlassFish embedded container, we can run these tests more efficiently and without the need for an external server installation. This approach improves the speed and reliability of our integration tests.

With the steps outlined in this blog post, you can now integrate the GlassFish embedded container into your Java project and leverage its capabilities for seamless integration testing. Happy testing!
