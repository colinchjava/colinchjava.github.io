In Java, **JNDI** (Java Naming and Directory Interface) and **Java IDL** (Interface Definition Language) are two powerful technologies that enable seamless integration between different components and systems. In this blog post, we will explore the integration of JNDI and Java IDL, and how they can be used together to create robust and scalable Java applications.

## What is JNDI? ##
JNDI is a Java API that allows Java applications to access various naming and directory services, such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or DNS (Domain Name System). It provides a common interface for interacting with different naming and directory services, abstracting the underlying implementation details.

JNDI allows applications to store and retrieve objects in a hierarchical naming structure, similar to a file system. It enables developers to look up and access resources, such as database connections, EJBs (Enterprise JavaBeans), or other network services, using a simple and consistent API.

## What is Java IDL? ##
Java IDL is a technology that allows Java applications to interact with objects in a distributed environment using the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) protocol. It enables seamless communication and interoperability between different programming languages and platforms.

Java IDL uses an Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the interfaces of remote objects. These IDL interfaces are then mapped to Java interfaces, which can be implemented by Java classes. Java IDL provides the necessary infrastructure and runtime support to enable method invocations and data transfers between distributed objects.

## Integration of JNDI and Java IDL ##
The integration of JNDI and Java IDL allows applications to use JNDI to look up and access CORBA objects. This integration provides a convenient way to interact with remote objects using the familiar JNDI API.

To integrate JNDI and Java IDL, you need to configure a JNDI service provider that supports the CORBA Naming Service. This service provider acts as a bridge between the JNDI API and the CORBA infrastructure.

Once the JNDI service provider is configured, you can use the JNDI API to look up the remote objects using their names or references. The JNDI API will use the underlying CORBA infrastructure to locate and communicate with the remote objects.
