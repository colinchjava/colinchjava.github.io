Microservices architecture has gained a lot of popularity in recent years due to its ability to build scalable and modular applications. However, building resilient microservices that can gracefully handle failures and ensure high availability is a critical aspect of designing robust systems. In this blog post, we will explore how GlassFish and Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance can help you achieve resiliency in your Java microservices.

## What is Fault Tolerance?

Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue functioning properly even in the presence of failures. In a microservices architecture, failures can occur due to network issues, service dependencies, or hardware failures. To build resilient microservices, we need mechanisms in place that can handle these failures and maintain the overall system stability.

## Introducing Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance

Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance is a specification that provides a set of fault tolerance primitives for building resilient microservices in Java. It includes features like timeout, retry, circuit breaker, and fallback methods to handle failures in a controlled manner.

## Getting Started with GlassFish and MicroProfile Fault Tolerance

### Step 1: Setup GlassFish Server

GlassFish is a popular Java application server that supports MicroProfile Fault Tolerance. To get started, [download GlassFish](https://glassfish.org/download.html) and install it on your local machine.

### Step 2: Create a Microservice

Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA). Add the required dependencies for GlassFish and MicroProfile Fault Tolerance to your project's Maven POM file.

```java
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.fault-tolerance</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile-fault-tolerance-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.0</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.fault-tolerance</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile-fault-tolerance-implementation</artifactId>
    <version>2.0</version>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>
```

### Step 3: Implement Fault Tolerance Primitives

Now, let's implement some fault tolerance primitives in our microservice. For example, to handle timeouts, we can annotate a method with `@Timeout`:

```java
import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Timeout;

@Timeout(500)
public void serviceCall() {
  // Perform the service call
}
```

In this example, the `serviceCall` method will timeout after 500 milliseconds if the response is not received within that time.

### Step 4: Deploy and Test

Finally, deploy your microservice to GlassFish and test its fault tolerance capabilities. You can simulate different failure scenarios and observe how the microservice behaves.

## Conclusion

Building resilient microservices is crucial for maintaining system stability in a distributed architecture. GlassFish and Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance offer a powerful combination for achieving fault tolerance in Java microservices. By using fault tolerance primitives like timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers, you can handle failures gracefully and ensure high availability of your microservices. Make sure to explore the various features of MicroProfile Fault Tolerance to build robust and resilient microservices.
