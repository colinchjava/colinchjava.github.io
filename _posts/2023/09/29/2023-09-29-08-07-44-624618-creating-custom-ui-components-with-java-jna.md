Java Native Access (JNA) is a powerful library that allows Java programs to call native functions and access native libraries without writing any C or C++ code. With JNA, you can easily integrate native functionality into your Java application.

One interesting use case of JNA is creating custom UI components by calling native UI libraries. In this blog post, we will walk through the process of creating a custom UI component with Java JNA.

## Step 1: Set up JNA

Before we can start creating custom UI components, we need to set up JNA in our Java project. 

1. Add the JNA dependency to your project's build file, such as Maven or Gradle.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.java.dev.jna</groupId>
    <artifactId>jna</artifactId>
    <version>5.9.0</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Import the JNA library and its related packages in your Java class.

```java
import com.sun.jna.Library;
import com.sun.jna.Native;
import com.sun.jna.platform.unix.X11;
```

## Step 2: Define the Native Library

Next, we need to define the native library interface that will be used to call the native UI functions. 

```java
public interface MyNativeLibrary extends Library {
    MyNativeLibrary INSTANCE = Native.load("mylib", MyNativeLibrary.class);
    
    void createCustomComponent(int width, int height);
    void drawCustomComponent();
}
```

In the above example, we define a native library interface called `MyNativeLibrary` which extends the `Library` class from JNA. We load the native library called "mylib" using the `Native.load()` method.

We define two native methods `createCustomComponent()` and `drawCustomComponent()` that will be called to create and draw our custom UI component.

## Step 3: Implement the Custom Component

Now, we can implement our custom UI component using the native functions.

```java
public class CustomComponent {
    private MyNativeLibrary nativeLibrary;
    
    public CustomComponent() {
        nativeLibrary = MyNativeLibrary.INSTANCE;
        nativeLibrary.createCustomComponent(100, 100);
    }
    
    public void draw() {
        nativeLibrary.drawCustomComponent();
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create an instance of `MyNativeLibrary` and call the `createCustomComponent()` method to create our custom UI component with a width and height of 100 pixels.

We also define a `draw()` method which will call the `drawCustomComponent()` method to draw our custom component.

## Step 4: Use the Custom Component

Finally, we can use our custom component in our Java application.

```java
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CustomComponent customComponent = new CustomComponent();
        // ...
        customComponent.draw();
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create an instance of `CustomComponent` and call the `draw()` method to render our custom UI component.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have seen how to create custom UI components using Java JNA. By leveraging the power of JNA, we can easily integrate native functionality and create unique and customized UI components for our Java applications.
