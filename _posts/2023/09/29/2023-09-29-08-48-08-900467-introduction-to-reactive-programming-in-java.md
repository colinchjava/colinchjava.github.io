In this blog post, we will introduce you to the basics of reactive programming in Java and show you how to get started with it.

## What is Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that deals with asynchronous data streams and the propagation of change. It focuses on event-driven applications and provides a way to handle multiple events concurrently.

In traditional programming, you write code that responds to events when they occur. However, with reactive programming, you define a series of operations that are executed whenever a new event is received. These operations can transform or combine the data streams in various ways.

## Reactive Streams API

Java provides the Reactive Streams API, which is a standard for implementing reactive programming in Java. It defines a set of interfaces and methods that allow you to work with asynchronous data streams.

To get started with reactive programming in Java, you need to add the Reactive Streams API dependency to your project. You can do this by adding the following Maven dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.reactivestreams</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactive-streams</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Once you have added the dependency, you can start using the Reactive Streams API in your code.

## Example Code

Here's a simple example to showcase reactive programming in Java using the Observable class from the Reactive Streams API:

```java
import io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Observable;

public class ReactiveExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Observable<String> stream = Observable.just("Hello", "World");

        stream.subscribe(
                System.out::println, // onNext callback
                Throwable::printStackTrace, // onError callback
                () -> System.out.println("Stream completed!") // onComplete callback
        );
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an Observable stream with two strings ("Hello" and "World"). We then subscribe to the stream and define three callbacks:

- `onNext`: This callback is called whenever a new value is emitted from the stream. In this case, we simply print the value to the console.
- `onError`: This callback is called if an error occurs during the stream processing.
- `onComplete`: This callback is called when the stream completes without any errors.

## Conclusion

Reactive programming in Java provides a powerful and efficient way to handle asynchronous and event-driven applications. By using the Reactive Streams API, you can easily work with data streams, react to events, and build reactive applications.

In this blog post, we introduced you to the basics of reactive programming in Java and demonstrated how to get started with it. We also provided a simple code example to showcase the usage of the Reactive Streams API.
