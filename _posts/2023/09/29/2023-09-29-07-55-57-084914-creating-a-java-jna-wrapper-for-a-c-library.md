Java Native Access (JNA) is a framework that allows Java applications to access native code written in other languages such as C or C++. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a JNA wrapper for a C library to enable Java applications to use its functionality.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- A C library that you want to create a Java wrapper for
- JNA library added to your Java project

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Create a new Java project in your IDE of choice and add the JNA library to your project's classpath. You can download the JNA library from the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) or include it as a Maven dependency in your `pom.xml` file.

## Step 2: Define the Java Interface

Create a Java interface that defines the methods and structures from the C library. Each method in the interface should correspond to a function in the C library. Use the `@Library` and `@Function` annotations to specify the library name and the function name.

```java
import com.sun.jna.Library;
import com.sun.jna.Native;
import com.sun.jna.Platform;

public interface ExampleLibrary extends Library {
    ExampleLibrary INSTANCE = Native.load(Platform.isWindows() ? "example.dll" : "example.so", ExampleLibrary.class);

    // Define method prototypes here
    int add(int a, int b);
}
```

## Step 3: Load and Use the Library

In your main Java class, load the library using the `Native.load` method and call the C library functions through the Java interface.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExampleLibrary exampleLibrary = ExampleLibrary.INSTANCE;

        // Use the library functions
        int result = exampleLibrary.add(5, 3);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Run and Test

Run the Java application and verify that the C library functions are successfully called. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the result printed to the console.

## Conclusion

Creating a Java JNA wrapper for a C library allows you to leverage existing C code in your Java applications. By defining a Java interface that corresponds to the C library functions, you can seamlessly integrate native functionality into your Java code. This enables you to tap into a wider range of libraries and leverage the power of native code in your Java applications.
