Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on asynchronous and event-driven programming to handle streams of data. It allows developers to build scalable and responsive applications by enabling efficient utilization of system resources.

In the Java ecosystem, there are several reactive web frameworks that provide support for building reactive applications. These frameworks take advantage of non-blocking I/O and event-driven designs to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.

## Spring WebFlux

One of the most popular reactive web frameworks in Java is **Spring WebFlux**, which is part of the Spring Framework. Spring WebFlux uses Project Reactor, an implementation of the Reactive Streams specification, to provide a fully reactive, non-blocking, and event-driven programming model.

To use Spring WebFlux, you need to define reactive endpoints using annotations such as `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`. Here's an example:

```java
@RestController
public class UserController {

  @Autowired
  private UserService userService;

  @GetMapping("/users")
  public Flux<User> getAllUsers() {
    return userService.getAllUsers();
  }

  // Other endpoint definitions...
}
```

In the example above, the `UserController` defines a `GET` endpoint `/users` that returns a `Flux<User>`, which represents a stream of users. This allows the application to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking.

## Vert.x

**Vert.x** is another popular reactive web framework in Java that provides an event-driven and reactive programming model. It allows developers to write scalable and resilient applications using a simple and intuitive API.

Vert.x leverages the Netty framework for efficient non-blocking I/O operations. It supports reactive programming using the Vert.x event bus and provides various reactive APIs for handling streams of data.

Here's an example of a simple HTTP server using Vert.x:

```java
public class Server {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
    
    vertx.createHttpServer()
    .requestHandler(req -> {
      req.response().end("Hello, World!");
    })
    .listen(8080);
  }
}
```

In the example above, the code creates an HTTP server using Vert.x and listens on port 8080. When a request is received, it responds with "Hello, World!".

## Conclusion

Reactive programming with reactive web frameworks in Java enables developers to build high-performance and scalable applications by leveraging non-blocking I/O and event-driven designs. Spring WebFlux and Vert.x are two popular frameworks in Java that provide support for reactive programming.

By embracing reactive programming, developers can take advantage of efficient utilization of system resources, better responsiveness, and enhanced scalability. The two examples provided above illustrate how to use Spring WebFlux and Vert.x to build reactive applications in Java.
