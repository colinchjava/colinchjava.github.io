## Filtering elements based on time

One common use case for time-based operations is filtering elements based on their timestamps. Let's say we have a list of events, and we want to filter out all events that occurred within the last hour. Here's how you can achieve this using the Streams API:

```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.util.List;

public class TimeBasedOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Event> events = getEvents(); // Assuming you have a method to retrieve the events

        LocalDateTime oneHourAgo = LocalDateTime.now().minusHours(1);

        List<Event> filteredEvents = events.stream()
                .filter(event -> event.getTimestamp().isAfter(oneHourAgo))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

        filteredEvents.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we first obtain the current datetime using `LocalDateTime.now()`, and then subtract one hour using the `minusHours()` method. We then use the `filter()` method on the stream to keep only the events that occurred after the calculated time. Finally, we collect the filtered events into a new list using `collect(Collectors.toList())`.

## Transforming elements based on time

Another useful application of time-based operations is transforming elements based on their timestamps. For example, let's say we have a list of stock prices, and we want to calculate the percentage change in price compared to the price one hour ago. Here's how you can do it using the Streams API:

```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.util.List;

public class TimeBasedOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<StockPrice> prices = getStockPrices(); // Assuming you have a method to retrieve the stock prices

        LocalDateTime oneHourAgo = LocalDateTime.now().minusHours(1);

        List<Double> percentageChanges = prices.stream()
                .filter(price -> price.getTimestamp().isAfter(oneHourAgo))
                .map(price -> (price.getCurrentPrice() - price.getPreviousPrice()) / price.getPreviousPrice() * 100)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

        percentageChanges.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we again calculate the datetime of one hour ago using `LocalDateTime.now().minusHours(1)`. We then filter the stream to keep only the stock prices that occurred after the calculated time. Next, we use the `map()` method to transform each stock price into its corresponding percentage change using a simple formula. Finally, we collect the percentage changes into a new list using `collect(Collectors.toList())`.

## Conclusion

Time-based operations are a powerful tool provided by the Java Streams API. They allow you to work efficiently with time-related data in a concise and expressive manner. By leveraging the `filter()` and `map()` methods, you can easily filter and transform elements based on their timestamps. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for time-based processing in your Java applications.
