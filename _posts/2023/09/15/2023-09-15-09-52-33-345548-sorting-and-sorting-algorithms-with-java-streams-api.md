Sorting is a fundamental operation in programming, and it becomes even more convenient with the Java Streams API. The Streams API provides a powerful way to work with collections and perform various operations, including sorting. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Java Streams API to sort data and discuss some commonly used sorting algorithms.

## Sorting with Java Streams API

With the Streams API introduced in Java 8, sorting a collection has become much simpler and more concise. The Streams API allows you to perform sorting using the `sorted()` method, which can be chained with other stream operations.

Let's take a look at how to use the `sorted()` method to sort a collection of integers in ascending order:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 3, 8, 2, 9);
List<Integer> sortedNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                    .sorted()
                                    .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(sortedNumbers);
```

Output: `[2, 3, 5, 8, 9]`

In the code snippet above, we create a list of integers `numbers` and convert it to a stream using the `stream()` method. We then chain the `sorted()` method to sort the stream elements in ascending order. Finally, we collect the sorted elements back into a list using the `collect()` method.

You can also sort a collection in descending order by using the `sorted()` method in combination with the `Comparator` interface. Here's an example:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 3, 8, 2, 9);
List<Integer> sortedNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                    .sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())
                                    .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(sortedNumbers);
```

Output: `[9, 8, 5, 3, 2]`

In the code above, we use `Comparator.reverseOrder()` to sort the stream elements in descending order.

## Commonly Used Sorting Algorithms

Under the hood, the Java Streams API uses a sorting algorithm to sort the elements. Although the implementation details are hidden from us, it's good to have a basic understanding of the commonly used sorting algorithms.

1. **Quicksort**: Quicksort is a popular divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts each sub-array recursively, and then combines the sorted sub-arrays to obtain a fully sorted array. Quicksort has an average time complexity of O(n log n) and performs well in practice.

2. **Mergesort**: Mergesort is another efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a sorted array. Mergesort also has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is stable, meaning that the order of equal elements is preserved.

3. **Heapsort**: Heapsort is based on the heap data structure and works by creating a max (or min) heap of the elements to be sorted. It repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap and places it at the end of the sorted array. Heapsort has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is not stable.

These are just a few examples of sorting algorithms, and there are many more available. The Java Streams API internally uses an efficient sorting algorithm optimized for various scenarios to provide high performance.
