The Java Streams API provides a functional programming approach to manipulate data in a declarative manner. It allows you to perform various operations on streams of data, such as filtering, transforming, and aggregating. By leveraging this API, you can easily build data governance pipelines to enforce rules and policies on your data.

To get started, let's assume we have a collection of data objects that need to be processed and validated in a data governance pipeline. Each data object represents a record from a data source.

```java
List<DataObject> dataObjects = // retrieve data from a data source
```

First, we can use the `filter` operation to remove any invalid data objects from the stream based on certain criteria. For example, let's filter out data objects that have missing required fields.

```java
List<DataObject> validDataObjects = dataObjects.stream()
    .filter(dataObject -> dataObject.isValid())
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

Next, we can use the `map` operation to transform the remaining data objects into a desired format. For example, let's transform the data objects into a different representation.

```java
List<ProcessedDataObject> processedDataObjects = validDataObjects.stream()
    .map(dataObject -> new ProcessedDataObject(dataObject.getField1(), dataObject.getField2()))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

Once the data objects are transformed, we can perform additional operations such as aggregation, statistics calculation, or data enrichment. These operations can be chained together using the various methods provided by the Streams API.

Finally, we can perform any necessary actions on the processed data objects, such as persisting them to a database or exporting them to another system.

```java
processedDataObjects.stream()
    .forEach(dataObject -> {
        // perform action on each data object
    });
```

By using the Java Streams API, we can easily implement data governance pipelines to validate, transform, and process data in a declarative and efficient manner. This approach allows for better maintainability, scalability, and reusability of data governance logic.
