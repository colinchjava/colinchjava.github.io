The Java Streams API introduced in Java 8 provides a powerful and expressive way to perform operations on collections of data. One of the key features of streams is lazy evaluation, which allows us to make our code more efficient by deferring the execution of operations until they are actually needed.

## Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation means that the operations in a stream are not executed immediately when invoked, but rather when the final result is requested. This allows streams to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.

Consider the following example:

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Mary", "David", "Alice");

Stream<String> stream = names.stream()
                             .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
                             .map(String::toUpperCase);

stream.forEach(System.out::println);
```

In this example, the `filter` and `map` operations are not executed until we call the `forEach` method. This means that if there are elements in the `names` list that don't satisfy the `startsWith("A")` predicate, or if there are no elements at all, these operations will never be performed.

## Short-Circuiting

Short-circuiting is another powerful feature of the Java Streams API. It allows us to stop the execution of operations as soon as a certain condition is met.

Consider the following example:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

Optional<Integer> result = numbers.stream()
                                  .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                  .findFirst();

result.ifPresent(System.out::println);
```

In this example, the `filter` operation checks if each number is divisible by 2. As soon as it finds the first even number (`2`), it stops iterating through the input stream and the `findFirst` operation is executed, returning the result. This saves unnecessary computations by not processing the remaining elements.

## Conclusion

Lazy evaluation and short-circuiting are powerful techniques provided by the Java Streams API. They allow us to write more efficient code by deferring computations and stopping them as soon as a condition is satisfied. By leveraging these features, we can improve the performance and readability of our code.
