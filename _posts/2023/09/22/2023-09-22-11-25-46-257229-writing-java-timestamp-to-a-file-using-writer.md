In Java, timestamps are commonly used to represent the current system time or a specific date and time. If you need to write a timestamp to a file using a `Writer`, you can follow the steps below.

1. Import the necessary Java classes:
```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.Writer;
import java.sql.Timestamp;
```

2. Create a `Timestamp` object using the `currentTimeMillis()` method of the `System` class:
```java
Timestamp timestamp = new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
```

3. Create a `Writer` object to write to the file. In this example, we'll use a `FileWriter` to write the timestamp to a file called `output.txt`:
```java
try (Writer writer = new FileWriter("output.txt")) {
    // Write the timestamp to the file
    writer.write(timestamp.toString());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

4. Close the `Writer` to release any resources it is holding:
```java
writer.close();
```

That's it! Now you have successfully written the Java timestamp to a file using `Writer`.

Keep in mind that when working with timestamps, you may want to format them in a specific way using `SimpleDateFormat` or other formatting options.

*Remember to replace `output.txt` with the desired file path and name.*
