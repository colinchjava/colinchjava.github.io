Docker has become a popular choice for containerizing Java applications due to its portability and scalability. However, managing shared libraries in Dockerized Java applications can be a challenge. In this blog post, we will explore some best practices for handling shared libraries in a Dockerized environment.

## Understanding shared libraries

Shared libraries, also known as dynamic-link libraries or .so files in Linux, are collections of precompiled code that can be used by multiple applications. In Java, shared libraries are typically packaged as JAR files that contain reusable code and resources.

## Including shared libraries in Docker images

To include shared libraries in a Docker image, you need to copy the necessary JAR files to the image during the build process. This can be done by using the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile. For example:

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

COPY ./*.jar /app/lib/
```

In this example, all JAR files in the current directory are copied to the `/app/lib/` directory in the Docker image.

## Setting up classpath in Docker containers

To ensure that the Java application uses the shared libraries correctly, you need to set up the classpath correctly in the Docker container. One approach is to use the `ENV` command in the Dockerfile to specify the classpath. For example:

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

COPY ./*.jar /app/lib/
ENV CLASSPATH /app/lib/*:/app/myapp.jar

CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/myapp.jar"]
```

In this example, we set the classpath to include all JAR files in the `/app/lib/` directory and the entry point `myapp.jar` using the `CLASSPATH` environment variable.

## Sharing the library cache

By default, each Docker container has its own isolated file system and library cache. This means that if you have multiple instances of the same Java application running in separate containers, each container will maintain its own copy of the shared libraries. This can increase the overall disk space usage and loading time for each container.

To mitigate this, you can use a data volume or a shared Docker volume to cache the shared libraries. By mounting the same volume to multiple containers, they can share the same library cache, reducing the disk space usage and improving the startup time. For example:

```shell
docker run -v my_shared_libs:/app/lib my_java_app
```

In this example, we create a Docker volume `my_shared_libs` and mount it to the `/app/lib` directory in the container. Multiple containers can then access the same volume, allowing them to share the library cache.

## Conclusion

Managing shared libraries in Dockerized Java applications requires careful consideration to ensure the correct inclusion and usage of the libraries. By following the best practices outlined in this blog post, you can effectively handle shared libraries in a Dockerized environment and optimize disk space and performance.
