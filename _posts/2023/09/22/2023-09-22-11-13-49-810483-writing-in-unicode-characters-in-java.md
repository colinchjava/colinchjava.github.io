To write Unicode characters in Java, you can use the escape sequence "\u" followed by the four-digit hexadecimal representation of the Unicode character. Here's an example:

```java
public class UnicodeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "\u0048\u0065\u006C\u006C\u006F, \u0057\u006F\u0072\u006C\u0064!";
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the escape sequence "\u" followed by the hexadecimal representation of each character to create a Unicode string. The hexadecimal values `\u0048`, `\u0065`, `\u006C`, and so on, correspond to the lowercase English letters 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', and the comma and exclamation mark.

When you run the code, it will output:

```
Hello, World!
```

By using Unicode characters, you can write code that handles text in different languages or includes special symbols. Java provides robust support for handling Unicode characters, making it well-suited for internationalization and localization purposes.

Remember to use a Unicode character set when compiling and running your Java program to ensure proper handling of Unicode characters. You can specify the character set using the `-encoding` flag when compiling and running the program from the command line, such as:

```shell
javac -encoding UTF-8 UnicodeExample.java
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 UnicodeExample
```

Using Unicode characters in Java allows you to create more inclusive and globally accessible applications. So go ahead and leverage the power of Unicode to enhance your Java code! #Java #Unicode
