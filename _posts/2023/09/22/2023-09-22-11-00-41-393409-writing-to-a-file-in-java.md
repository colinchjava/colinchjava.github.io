Before writing data to a file, we first need to obtain a reference to the file we want to write to. This can be done using the File class. Let's assume we want to write to a file called "output.txt" located in the current directory:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriteExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify the file path
        String filePath = "output.txt";

        try {
            // Create a FileWriter object
            FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(filePath);

            // Write data to the file
            writer.write("Hello, World!");

            // Close the writer
            writer.close();

            System.out.println("Data has been written to the file successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while writing to the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a FileWriter object by passing the file path as a parameter. We can then use the `write()` method to write data to the file. Once we are done writing, we should always close the FileWriter object to ensure the data is flushed and any system resources associated with the file are released.

It is important to handle any potential IOException that may occur when performing file operations. In the catch block, we print an error message and the stack trace to help debug any issues.

When executing this code, it will create a new file "output.txt" in the current directory (or overwrite an existing file with the same name), and write the string "Hello, World!" to the file.

Remember to handle exceptions properly when working with file operations in Java.
