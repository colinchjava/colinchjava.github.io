When working with text data in Java, it is important to handle character encodings properly to ensure the correct interpretation of characters. One such encoding is the **ISO-8859-10** encoding, which is used for the Latin alphabet with additional characters needed for writing the Nordic languages.

To write in the ISO-8859-10 encoding in Java, you can use the `OutputStreamWriter` class combined with the `FileOutputStream` class to write text to a file. Here's an example:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class ISO885910Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify the file path and name
        String filePath = "path/to/file.txt";

        try {
            // Create a FileOutputStream with ISO-8859-10 encoding
            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(filePath);
            OutputStreamWriter osw = new OutputStreamWriter(fos, "ISO-8859-10");

            // Write the text to the file
            String text = "This is an example text in ISO-8859-10 encoding.";
            osw.write(text);

            // Close the writers
            osw.close();
            fos.close();

            System.out.println("Text written successfully in the ISO-8859-10 encoding.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, we first define the file path where we want to write the text. Then, we create a `FileOutputStream` with the specified file path. We pass this to the `OutputStreamWriter` constructor, along with the "ISO-8859-10" encoding.

We then write the desired text to the `OutputStreamWriter` and close the writer streams after writing is complete. Finally, we display a success message on the console.

Remember to handle the `IOException` properly when working with file operations.

With this example, you should now be able to write text in the ISO-8859-10 encoding in Java.
