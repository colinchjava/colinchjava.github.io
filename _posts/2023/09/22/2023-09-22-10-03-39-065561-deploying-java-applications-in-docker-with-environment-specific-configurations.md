With the rise of containerization, Docker has become a popular choice for deploying Java applications. Docker allows you to package your application with all its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments. However, managing environment-specific configurations can be challenging. In this blog post, we will explore different approaches to handle environment-specific configurations when deploying Java applications in Docker.

## Approach 1: Environment Variables

Using environment variables is a common and convenient way to configure your Java application in Docker. You can define environment-specific configurations as variables in your container, which can then be accessed by your Java application at runtime.

To use environment variables in your Java application, you can leverage libraries like [dotenv](https://github.com/cdimascio/java-dotenv) or [Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config) to load the values. These libraries make it easy to read and parse values from environment variables.

To set environment variables in Docker, you can use the `-e` flag followed by the variable name and its value when running the container.

```docker
docker run -e ENV_VARIABLE_NAME=ENV_VARIABLE_VALUE my-java-app
```

## Approach 2: Configuration Files

Another approach is to use configuration files stored in the Docker container. You can package different configuration files for each environment and use the appropriate file based on the environment in which the container is run.

To achieve this, you can create a separate directory inside your Docker container that contains different configuration files for each environment (e.g., `config/development.conf`, `config/production.conf`). Then, you can mount the appropriate configuration file when running the container using the `-v` flag.

```docker
docker run -v /path/to/config/development.conf:/app/config/application.conf my-java-app
```

Within your Java application, you can load the configuration file using libraries like [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config) or [Spring Boot's Externalized Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config).

## Conclusion

When deploying Java applications in Docker, managing environment-specific configurations is essential for ensuring consistency across different environments. In this blog post, we explored two approaches: using environment variables and using configuration files. Both approaches have their benefits, and the choice depends on your specific use case.

By leveraging environment variables or configuration files, you can easily handle environment-specific configurations when deploying Java applications in Docker, making your deployment process more streamlined and scalable.
