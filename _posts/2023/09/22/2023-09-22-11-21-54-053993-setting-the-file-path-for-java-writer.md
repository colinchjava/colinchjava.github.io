To set the file path for a `FileWriter` object in Java, you can simply provide the absolute or relative path as a parameter when creating an instance of the class. Here's an example:

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriteExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "C:/myFolder/myFile.txt"; // Setting the file path

        try {
            FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(filePath);

            // Perform file writing operations here

            writer.close(); // Remember to close the file writer
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `filePath` variable represents the file path where the `myFile.txt` will be created. You can specify either an absolute path (like `C:/myFolder/myFile.txt`) or a relative path depending on your requirements.

Remember to handle any `IOException` that may occur when working with file operations by using try-catch blocks. Also, ensure that you close the `FileWriter` object after you are done with writing to the file.

By setting the file path correctly, you can easily write data to the desired location in Java.
