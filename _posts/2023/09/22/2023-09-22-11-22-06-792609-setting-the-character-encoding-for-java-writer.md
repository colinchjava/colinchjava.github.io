The character encoding of a Writer can be set by using the appropriate constructor or method from the Java API. Let's take a look at a couple of examples:

1. Using the OutputStreamWriter constructor:
```java
OutputStream outputStream = ...; // Your output stream
String encoding = "UTF-8"; // The desired character encoding
Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream, encoding);
```
In this example, we are creating an OutputStreamWriter object by passing the output stream and the desired character encoding ("UTF-8") to the constructor. The Writer object created will use the specified encoding for writing characters to the output stream.

2. Using the setEncoding() method:
```java
Writer writer = ...; // Your Writer object
String encoding = "UTF-8"; // The desired character encoding
((OutputStreamWriter) writer).setEncoding(encoding);
```
In this example, we assume that you already have a Writer object reference. We cast it to an OutputStreamWriter (assuming it is one) and then use the setEncoding() method to set the desired character encoding.

Remember to replace "UTF-8" with the appropriate encoding for your specific use case. Common encodings include UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO-8859-1, and US-ASCII. You can find a list of all supported encodings in the Java documentation.

By setting the character encoding for your Java Writer, you can ensure that your application handles characters correctly, especially when dealing with different languages and special characters.
