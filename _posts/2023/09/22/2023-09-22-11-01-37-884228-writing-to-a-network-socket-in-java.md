To write to a network socket in Java, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a Socket object
To establish a connection to a specific IP address and port number, we first need to create a Socket object. You can use the Socket class provided by Java to do this. Here's an example:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketWriter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a new Socket object
            Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080);

            // Get the OutputStream of the socket
            OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();

            // Write data to the socket
            String data = "Hello, world!";
            outputStream.write(data.getBytes());

            // Close the socket and the stream
            outputStream.close();
            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create a new `Socket` object and specify the IP address ("localhost" in this case) and port number (8080) to connect to. We then get the `OutputStream` of the socket and write data to it using the `write()` method.

Step 2: Close the socket and stream
After we have finished writing data to the socket, it is essential to close the socket and the associated output stream to release system resources. Closing the stream also ensures that all the data is properly sent to the receiving end.

Keep in mind that writing to a network socket involves error handling, especially when dealing with issues such as network connectivity problems or server unavailability. It is good practice to wrap the code in a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur.

In conclusion, writing to a network socket in Java can be achieved using the `Socket` and `OutputStream` classes. By following the provided steps, you can establish a connection to a specific IP address and port number and send data successfully.
