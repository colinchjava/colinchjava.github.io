In Java, encoding is used to specify the character set to be used when transforming characters into bytes or vice versa. ISO-8859-13 is a character encoding standard that supports the Baltic languages.

To write data using the ISO-8859-13 encoding in Java, follow these steps:

1. Create a `OutputStream` object to write the data.
2. Wrap the `OutputStream` with an `OutputStreamWriter` and specify the encoding as `"ISO-8859-13"`.
3. Use the `write()` method of the `OutputStreamWriter` to write the data.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates writing a string in ISO-8859-13 encoding:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String data = "This is a sample text in ISO-8859-13 encoding";
            OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
            Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream, "ISO-8859-13");
            writer.write(data);
            writer.close();
            System.out.println("Data written successfully in ISO-8859-13 encoding.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a `FileOutputStream` object to write the data to a file named `output.txt`. We then wrap the `FileOutputStream` with an `OutputStreamWriter`, specifying the encoding as `"ISO-8859-13"`. The `write()` method is used to write the string data in the desired encoding.

Make sure to handle any potential `IOException` that may occur while writing the data.

Remember to import the necessary classes from the `java.io` package.
