In this blog post, we'll explore the process of building Docker images for Java applications while using specific JDK (Java Development Kit) versions. Docker provides a simple and efficient way to package and distribute applications, making it an ideal choice for running Java applications in a containerized environment.

## Why use specific JDK versions?

Java applications often require specific JDK versions to ensure compatibility and proper functioning. Different versions of the JDK may introduce new features, bug fixes, or security updates, and it's important to align your application with the appropriate JDK version to ensure stability and performance.

## Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

To build a Docker image for your Java application, start by creating a `Dockerfile` in your project directory. This file will contain the instructions used by Docker to pull the base image, install the appropriate JDK version, and copy your application's code into the image.

```Dockerfile
# Use a specific JDK version as the base image
FROM openjdk:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application jar file to the container
COPY target/my-application.jar my-application.jar

# Run the application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "my-application.jar"]
```

In the example above, we are using the `openjdk:14` base image, which corresponds to JDK version 14. 

## Step 2: Build the Docker image

To build the Docker image, execute the following command in your project directory:

```shell
docker build -t my-application:1.0 .
```

This command will build a Docker image with the tag `my-application:1.0`, using the `Dockerfile` located in the current directory (`.`).

## Step 3: Run the Docker container

Once the Docker image is built, you can run a container based on that image using the following command:

```shell
docker run my-application:1.0
```

This command will start a Docker container based on the `my-application:1.0` image, and your Java application will be executed within the container.

## Conclusion

Building Docker images for Java applications with specific JDK versions is an essential practice to ensure compatibility and stability. By using the appropriate JDK version in your Dockerfile, you can easily package and distribute your Java applications in a containerized environment.

Remember to choose the JDK version that best suits the requirements of your application and keep your Docker images up to date with the latest JDK updates and security patches.
