In Java, the `PipedWriter` class is used for writing data to a connected `PipedReader`. It is a convenient way to implement communication between two threads within the same process or between different processes.

## Usage

To use `PipedWriter`, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of `PipedWriter` by passing a `PipedReader` as a parameter to the constructor.
    ```java
    PipedWriter writer = new PipedWriter(new PipedReader());
    ```

2. Write data to the `PipedWriter` using the `write()` method.
    ```java
    writer.write("Hello, PipedWriter!");
    ```

3. Close the `PipedWriter` to ensure that all the data is flushed and any resources are released.
    ```java
    writer.close();
    ```

## Example

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `PipedWriter` in Java:

```java
import java.io.PipedReader;
import java.io.PipedWriter;

public class PipedWriterExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Creating PipedReader and PipedWriter
            PipedReader reader = new PipedReader();
            PipedWriter writer = new PipedWriter(reader);

            // Creating a thread to read from PipedReader
            Thread readerThread = new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    int data;
                    while ((data = reader.read()) != -1) {
                        System.out.print((char) data);
                    }
                    reader.close();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });

            // Start the reader thread
            readerThread.start();

            // Writing data to PipedWriter
            writer.write("Hello, PipedWriter!");

            // Close the PipedWriter
            writer.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, a `PipedReader` is connected to a `PipedWriter`. The `PipedWriter` writes the string "Hello, PipedWriter!" and the `PipedReader` reads and prints the data. Finally, both the `PipedWriter` and `PipedReader` are closed.

## Conclusion

The `PipedWriter` and `PipedReader` classes provide a simple way to implement communication between threads using pipes. It is important to note that these classes should be used within a single process or within processes that are connected through an interprocess communication mechanism.
