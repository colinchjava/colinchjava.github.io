In Java, we can use `OutputStreamWriter` to write data to a file. It converts the characters into bytes and writes them to the underlying output stream. Here's an example that demonstrates how to write data to a file using `OutputStreamWriter`.

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

public class FileWriterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filename = "output.txt";
        String data = "Hello, world!";

        // Create FileOutputStream
        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(filename);
             OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(fos, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {
            
            // Write data to the file
            writer.write(data);

            // Flush and close the writer
            writer.flush();
            writer.close();

            System.out.println("Data has been written to the file successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we first define the filename and the data that we want to write to the file. We then create a `FileOutputStream` by providing the filename. 

Next, we create an `OutputStreamWriter` by passing the `FileOutputStream` and the character encoding (in this case, `StandardCharsets.UTF_8`). This ensures that the characters are correctly converted to bytes using the specified encoding.

We then write the data to the file using the `write` method of the `OutputStreamWriter`. After writing, we flush and close the writer to ensure that all the data is written and the resources are properly released.

Finally, we print a success message to indicate that the data has been written to the file successfully.

Make sure to handle any `IOException` that may occur during the file writing process.

With this example, you now know how to use `OutputStreamWriter` to write data to a file in Java. Happy coding!
