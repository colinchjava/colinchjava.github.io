One of the most common tasks when dealing with file compression in Java is writing to a GZIPOutputStream. This class allows you to compress data using the gzip algorithm, which can significantly reduce file sizes.

To get started, you'll need to import the `java.util.zip` package, which contains the necessary classes for working with compression in Java. Here's an example of how to write to a GZIPOutputStream:

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream;

public class GzipExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sourceFile = "path/to/source/file.txt";
        String compressedFile = "path/to/compressed/file.txt.gz";

        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(compressedFile);
             GZIPOutputStream gzipOS = new GZIPOutputStream(fos)) {

            // Read the source file and write compressed data to the GZIPOutputStream
            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
            int len;
            try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(sourceFile)) {
                while ((len = fis.read(buffer)) > 0) {
                    gzipOS.write(buffer, 0, len);
                }
            }

            System.out.println("File compressed successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we first define the paths to the source file and the compressed file. These paths can be adjusted based on your specific requirements.

We then create a `FileOutputStream` with the path to the compressed file. This stream is used as the underlying output stream for the `GZIPOutputStream`. Inside the `try` block, we create a `GZIPOutputStream` object, passing the `FileOutputStream` as a parameter.

Next, we read the data from the source file in chunks and write it to the `GZIPOutputStream` until all data is processed. Finally, we print a success message if the compression process is completed without any exceptions.

Remember to handle any potential `IOException` that may occur when working with file streams.

That's it! You now have the basic code to write to a `GZIPOutputStream` in Java. The resulting file will be compressed using the gzip algorithm, ready for further distribution or storage.
