Java provides built-in support for handling different character encodings, including UTF-16BE. UTF-16BE (UTF-16 Big Endian) is a character encoding scheme that uses 16 bits to represent each character, with the most significant byte first.

To write data in UTF-16BE encoding in Java, you can use the `OutputStreamWriter` class along with a `FileOutputStream`. Here's an example that demonstrates how to write UTF-16BE encoded text to a file:

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

public class UTF16BEWriterExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello, world!";

        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
             OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(fos, StandardCharsets.UTF_16BE)) {
            writer.write(text);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while writing the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `FileOutputStream` to write the data to a file, and then wrap it with an `OutputStreamWriter`. We pass `StandardCharsets.UTF_16BE` as the charset parameter to indicate that we want to write the data in UTF-16BE encoding.

The `write()` method of the `OutputStreamWriter` class is used to write the text to the file. If any errors occur during the writing process, an `IOException` will be thrown. We catch the exception and display an error message in the console.

Remember to handle any exceptions that can occur during file operations, such as file not found or I/O errors.

Remember to use proper exception handling in your production code.

By writing your data in UTF-16BE encoding, you can ensure that it can be correctly read by applications or systems that expect this specific encoding.
