Writing to the standard output, also known as **stdout**, is a common task when developing Java applications. It allows you to display information or results to the user or to another program that is consuming your application's output.

In Java, you can write to the standard output using the `System.out` stream. It is an instance of the `PrintStream` class and provides methods to display text on the console.

### Using `System.out.println()`

The simplest way to write to the standard output in Java is by using the `println()` method of the `System.out` stream. This method prints the specified string followed by a newline character (i.e., it appends a line break after the text). Here's an example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

When you run this code, it will display the message "Hello, world!" on the console:

```
Hello, world!
```

### Using `System.out.print()`

If you don't want a line break after the text, you can use the `print()` method instead. It works similarly to `println()`, but it doesn't add a newline character. Here's an example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello, ");
        System.out.println("world!");
    }
}
```

When you run this code, it will display the following output:

```
Hello, world!
```

### Formatting Output

In addition to simple string printing, `System.out` provides various methods to format output. For example, you can use the `printf()` method to display formatted text using placeholders. Here's an example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "John";
        int age = 25;
        System.out.printf("My name is %s and I am %d years old.%n", name, age);
    }
}
```

Running this code will produce the following output:

```
My name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

The `%s` placeholder is used for strings, while `%d` is used for integers. The `%n` is a platform-independent line separator.

### Conclusion

Writing to the standard output is a fundamental aspect of Java development. By using `System.out`, you can easily display messages, results, or formatted output to the console. Whether you are debugging your code or providing information to the user, the standard output is a valuable tool to communicate with the outside world.
