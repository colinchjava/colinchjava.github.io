In Java, you can specify the character encoding when reading or writing text data to ensure that the correct character set is used. If you need to write text in ISO-8859-4 encoding, you can do so by following these steps.

First, make sure you have the necessary import statement at the top of your Java file:

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
```

Next, you can create a `FileOutputStream` and wrap it in an `OutputStreamWriter` to specify the desired encoding. In this case, we can use `"ISO-8859-4"` to write text in the ISO-8859-4 character set:

```java
try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
     OutputStreamWriter osw = new OutputStreamWriter(fos, "ISO-8859-4");
     BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(osw)) {

    String text = "Writing text in ISO-8859-4 encoding";
    writer.write(text);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the above example, we create a `FileOutputStream` with the filename "output.txt". We then wrap it in an `OutputStreamWriter` and specify the encoding as `"ISO-8859-4"`. The `BufferedWriter` is used to efficiently write the text data.

Finally, we can use the `write()` method of the `BufferedWriter` to write the desired text in ISO-8859-4 encoding. In this example, we write the string "Writing text in ISO-8859-4 encoding".

Make sure to handle any potential `IOException` that may occur during the process.

That's it! You have now successfully written text in ISO-8859-4 encoding using Java.
