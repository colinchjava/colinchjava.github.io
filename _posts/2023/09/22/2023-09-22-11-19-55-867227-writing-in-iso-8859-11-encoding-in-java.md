Java provides extensive support for handling different character encodings, including ISO-8859-11. In this blog post, we will explore how to write text in the ISO-8859-11 encoding using Java.

ISO-8859-11 is a character encoding standard that is primarily used for representing the Thai script. It is a part of the ISO 8859 series of standards, which defines several 8-bit character encodings for various languages and scripts.

To write text in the ISO-8859-11 encoding in Java, you can use the `OutputStreamWriter` class along with the `ISO-8859-11` character set.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to write a string in the ISO-8859-11 encoding:

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

public class Iso8859EncodingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "สวัสดี"; // Thai text
        
        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
             OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(fos, StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_11)) {
            
            writer.write(text);
            writer.flush();
            
            System.out.println("Text written successfully in ISO-8859-11 encoding.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a `FileOutputStream` to write the text to a file named "output.txt". We then wrap the `FileOutputStream` with an `OutputStreamWriter`, which allows us to specify the character set as `ISO-8859-11` using the `StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_11` constant.

Finally, we call the `write()` method on the `OutputStreamWriter` to write the string in the specified encoding. We flush the writer to ensure that all the data is written to the output file. 

Make sure to handle any potential `IOException` that may occur during the writing process.

By using this approach, you can write text in the ISO-8859-11 encoding in Java. This is particularly useful when dealing with Thai text or any other content that requires the ISO-8859-11 encoding.
