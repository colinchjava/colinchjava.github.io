In Java, you can use the `Writer` class to write a `double` value to a file. The `Writer` class is an abstract class for writing character streams, which includes writing numeric values.

Here's an example of how to write a `double` to a file using `Writer`:

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.Writer;

public class DoubleWriterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double number = 3.14159;
        String filename = "output.txt";

        try (Writer writer = new FileWriter(filename)) {
            writer.write(Double.toString(number));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we define a `double` variable `number` with the value `3.14159` and specify the name of the output file as `output.txt`. 

We then use the `Writer` class to create a new file writer with the specified file name. Inside the try-with-resources block, we call the `write` method of the `Writer` object and pass `Double.toString(number)` as the argument. This converts the `double` value to a `String` and writes it to the file.

The code also handles any `IOException` that may occur during the file writing process using a `catch` block. If an exception occurs, the stack trace will be printed to the console.

Make sure to handle the `IOException` appropriately in your application, such as displaying an error message to the user or logging the exception.

Remember to close the `Writer` object at the end to release any system resources it holds by using the try-with-resources statement. This ensures proper resource management and prevents memory leaks.

That's it! Now you know how to write a `double` to a file using `Writer` in Java.
