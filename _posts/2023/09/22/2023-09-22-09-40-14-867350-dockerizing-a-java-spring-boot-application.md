In this blog post, we will explore the process of dockerizing a Java Spring Boot application. Docker allows us to package our application along with its dependencies into a container, ensuring that it can run consistently across different environments.

## Why Dockerize a Java Spring Boot application?

Dockerization offers several benefits for Java Spring Boot applications:

1. **Portability**: With Docker containers, we can package our Spring Boot application along with its dependencies, making it highly portable and runnable on any machine that has Docker installed.

2. **Isolation**: Docker provides process isolation, ensuring that our application runs in a controlled environment without interfering with other applications or system resources.

3. **Dependency management**: Docker containers allow us to wrap all the dependencies required by our Spring Boot application, making it easier to manage and deploy.

Now, let's dive into the process of dockerizing a Java Spring Boot application.

## Steps to Dockerize a Java Spring Boot application

### 1. Create a Dockerfile

The first step is to create a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains a sequence of instructions to build a Docker image. Below is an example of a simple Dockerfile for a Java Spring Boot application:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./target/my-spring-boot-app.jar /app
CMD ["java", "-jar", "my-spring-boot-app.jar"]
```

In this Dockerfile:

- `FROM`: Specifies the base Docker image we want to use. In this case, we are using the official OpenJDK 11 image.
- `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory inside the container.
- `COPY`: Copies the compiled JAR file of our Spring Boot application into the container's working directory.
- `CMD`: Specifies the command to run when the container starts. In this case, we are running the Spring Boot application using the `java -jar` command.

### 2. Build the Docker image

After creating the Dockerfile, we can use the `docker build` command to build a Docker image. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and execute the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-spring-boot-app .
```

This command builds a Docker image with the tag `my-spring-boot-app`.

### 3. Run the Docker container

Once the Docker image is built, we can run the container using the `docker run` command. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-spring-boot-app
```

This command runs the Docker container and maps port 8080 of the host machine to port 8080 of the container.

## Conclusion

Dockerizing a Java Spring Boot application provides numerous benefits, including portability, isolation, and dependency management. Using a Dockerfile, we can easily package our application into a Docker image and run it consistently across different environments.
