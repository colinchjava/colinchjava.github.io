In this blog post, we will explore how to use Hazelcast's distributed transactional caches in Java applications. Distributed transactional caches provide a reliable and scalable solution for managing transactional data across a distributed system.

## What is Hazelcast?

Hazelcast is an open-source in-memory data grid that provides a distributed caching solution. It allows you to seamlessly distribute your data across multiple nodes in a cluster, providing high availability and fault tolerance.

## Setting up Hazelcast

To use Hazelcast in your Java application, you need to add the Hazelcast Maven dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Next, you need to configure the Hazelcast instance. Here's an example of setting up a Hazelcast instance with default configuration:

```java
Config config = new Config();
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
```

## Creating a Distributed Transactional Cache

To create a distributed transactional cache, we can make use of Hazelcast's `TransactionalMap` interface. Here's an example of creating a distributed transactional cache:

```java
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = ... // Get Hazelcast instance
TransactionalMap<String, Integer> cache = hazelcastInstance.getTransactionalMap("my-cache");
```

In the above example, we create a transactional cache named "my-cache" using the `getTransactionalMap` method. The key-value pairs stored in this cache can be accessed and modified within a distributed transaction.

## Performing Transactions

To perform a transaction on the distributed cache, you need to wrap your code within a `TransactionContext`. Here's an example of starting a transaction, performing some operations on the cache, and committing the transaction:

```java
TransactionContext transactionContext = hazelcastInstance.newTransactionContext();
transactionContext.beginTransaction();

try {
    TransactionalMap<String, Integer> cache = transactionContext.getMap("my-cache");

    // Perform operations on the cache
    cache.put("key1", 10);
    cache.put("key2", 20);

    transactionContext.commitTransaction();
} catch (TransactionException e) {
    transactionContext.rollbackTransaction();
    throw e;
}
```

In the above example, we start a transaction using `beginTransaction()`, perform some operations on the cache (putting key-value pairs), and finally commit the transaction using `commitTransaction()`. If an exception occurs during the transaction, we rollback the transaction using `rollbackTransaction()`.

## Conclusion

Hazelcast provides a powerful distributed caching solution for Java applications. By leveraging its distributed transactional caches, you can ensure data consistency and reliability in a distributed system. In this blog post, we explored how to set up Hazelcast and create and perform transactions on distributed transactional caches.
