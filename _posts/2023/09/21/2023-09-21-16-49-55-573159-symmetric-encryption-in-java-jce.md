Symmetric encryption is a widely used cryptographic technique where the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data. Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provides a set of cryptographic algorithms and APIs to perform symmetric encryption in Java.

In this blog post, we will explore how to perform symmetric encryption using JCE in Java.

## Setup

Before we start, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. JCE comes bundled with the JDK, so no additional installation is required.

## Choosing an Algorithm and Mode

To perform symmetric encryption, we need to choose an encryption algorithm and a mode of operation. JCE provides various algorithms and modes to choose from, such as AES, DES, and Blowfish. It is important to choose a secure algorithm and a suitable mode based on your requirements.

For this example, let's choose the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.

## Generating a Secret Key

Symmetric encryption requires a secret key. JCE provides the `KeyGenerator` class to generate secret keys. Here's an example of generating a secret key using the AES algorithm:

```java
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;

// Generate AES secret key
KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
keyGen.init(256); // 256-bit key size
SecretKey secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();
```

## Encrypting and Decrypting Data

Once we have a secret key, we can encrypt and decrypt data using the `Cipher` class provided by JCE.

Here's an example of how to encrypt and decrypt data using AES with CBC mode:

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.Base64;

// Encrypt data
String plainText = "Hello, World!";
byte[] plainTextBytes = plainText.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);

byte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(plainTextBytes);

// Decrypt data
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
byte[] decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(encryptedBytes);

String decryptedText = new String(decryptedBytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

System.out.println("Decrypted Text: " + decryptedText);
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to perform symmetric encryption in Java using JCE. We explored how to choose an algorithm and mode, generate a secret key, and encrypt/decrypt data using the `Cipher` class.

Symmetric encryption is an essential technique for securing data, and JCE provides a convenient way to implement it in Java.
