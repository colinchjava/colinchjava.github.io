When dealing with large amounts of data in a Java application, it is essential to have effective eviction policies in place to manage memory consumption and ensure optimal performance. **Hazelcast IMDG (In-Memory Data Grid)** provides a range of eviction policies that can be used to control the lifecycle of data objects in the in-memory cache.

In this article, we will explore how to use Hazelcast IMDG eviction policies in Java applications and understand their significance in managing memory resources efficiently.

## What are Eviction Policies?

Eviction policies are algorithms that determine which data objects should be removed from the in-memory cache when it reaches its capacity limit. This is essential to prevent memory overflow and ensure that the cache contains only the most relevant data.

Hazelcast IMDG provides several built-in eviction policies, including:

- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: Removes the least recently accessed data objects first.
- **Least Frequently Used (LFU)**: Removes the least frequently accessed data objects first.
- **Random Eviction**: Randomly removes data objects from the cache.

## Configuration in Java

To use eviction policies in a Hazelcast IMDG cache, you need to configure them in your Java application. Here's an example of how to configure the `LRU` eviction policy:

```java
Config config = new Config();
CacheSimpleConfig cacheConfig = new CacheSimpleConfig();
EvictionConfig evictionConfig = new EvictionConfig();
evictionConfig.setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy.LRU);

// Set the maximum size for the cache
evictionConfig.setMaximumSizePolicy(MaxSizePolicy.PER_NODE);
evictionConfig.setSize(10000);

cacheConfig.setEvictionConfig(evictionConfig);
config.addCacheConfig(cacheConfig);
```

In this example, we create a `CacheSimpleConfig` object and configure the eviction policy to use `LRU`. We then set the `MaximumSizePolicy` to `PER_NODE`, indicating that the maximum size is on a per-node basis. Finally, we set the maximum size of the cache to 10,000.

## Custom Eviction Policies

Apart from the built-in eviction policies, you can also implement custom eviction policies in Hazelcast IMDG. To do this, you need to implement the `EvictionPolicy` interface and override the `compare` method to define your custom eviction algorithm.

```java
public class CustomEvictionPolicy implements EvictionPolicy<Object, Object> {
    @Override
    public int compare(EvictableEntry<Object, Object> o1, EvictableEntry<Object, Object> o2) {
        // Custom eviction logic goes here
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Once you have implemented your custom eviction policy, you can set it in the Hazelcast configuration as follows:

```java
EvictionConfig evictionConfig = new EvictionConfig();
evictionConfig.setEvictionPolicy(new CustomEvictionPolicy());
```

## Conclusion

Efficiently managing memory resources is crucial for the performance and scalability of Java applications. With Hazelcast IMDG eviction policies, you can control how data objects are evicted from the in-memory cache, ensuring that you always have the most relevant data available.

In this article, we explored the built-in eviction policies provided by Hazelcast IMDG and saw how to configure them in Java applications. We also learned how to implement and use custom eviction policies to suit specific application needs.

By using these eviction policies effectively, you can optimize memory usage and improve the overall efficiency of your Java applications.
