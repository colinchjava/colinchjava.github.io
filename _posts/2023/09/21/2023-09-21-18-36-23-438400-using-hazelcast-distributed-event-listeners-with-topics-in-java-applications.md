In distributed systems where multiple components need to communicate with each other, event-driven architecture plays a vital role. Hazelcast, a popular open-source in-memory data grid, provides a powerful event system called *Topics* that allows components within the cluster to publish and subscribe to events.

This blog post will demonstrate how to use Hazelcast distributed event listeners with topics in Java applications.

## Setting up Hazelcast

To begin, we need to include the Hazelcast dependency in our Java application. Add the following Maven dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>4.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure you have a running Hazelcast cluster or create one using the Hazelcast client configuration.

## Publishing Events

To publish events to a Hazelcast topic, we can use the `ITopic` interface. Here's an example:

```java
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import com.hazelcast.core.ITopic;

public class EventPublisher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        ITopic<String> topic = hazelcastInstance.getTopic("my-topic");
        
        topic.publish("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

In the above example, we instantiate a `HazelcastInstance` and retrieve a `ITopic` with the name "my-topic". We then publish an event by invoking the `publish` method on the `ITopic` instance.

## Subscribing to Events

To receive events from a Hazelcast topic, we can register a `MessageListener` to the desired topic. Here's an example:

```java
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import com.hazelcast.core.ITopic;
import com.hazelcast.core.Message;
import com.hazelcast.core.MessageListener;

public class EventSubscriber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        ITopic<String> topic = hazelcastInstance.getTopic("my-topic");
        
        topic.addMessageListener(new MessageListener<String>() {
            @Override
            public void onMessage(Message<String> message) {
                String event = message.getMessageObject();
                System.out.println("Received event: " + event);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a `MessageListener` implementation and override the `onMessage` method to process the received event. We then register the listener to the topic using the `addMessageListener` method.

## Conclusion

Hazelcast provides a convenient way to implement distributed event listeners using topics. By publishing and subscribing to events, components within a cluster can seamlessly communicate and react to changes or updates. This event-driven architecture can greatly enhance the scalability and performance of Java applications.
