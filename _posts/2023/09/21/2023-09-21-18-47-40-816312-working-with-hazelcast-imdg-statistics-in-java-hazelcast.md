To start using Hazelcast IMDG statistics in your Java application, you first need to create a Hazelcast instance. This can be done using the HazelcastConfig class, where you can define various configuration options for your cluster. Once you have created the instance, you can obtain the HazelcastInstance object and use it to access the statistics:

```java
import com.hazelcast.config.Config;
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import com.hazelcast.core.IMap;

public class HazelcastStatisticsExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Hazelcast instance
        Config config = new Config();
        HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
        
        // Get the distributed map
        IMap<String, String> map = hazelcastInstance.getMap("myMap");
        
        // Perform some operations on the map
        map.put("key1", "value1");
        map.put("key2", "value2");
        
        // Get the statistics object
        LocalMapStats localMapStats = map.getLocalMapStats();
        
        // Check the statistics
        System.out.println("Number of entries: " + localMapStats.getOwnedEntryCount());
        System.out.println("Number of puts: " + localMapStats.getPutOperationCount());
        System.out.println("Number of gets: " + localMapStats.getGetOperationCount());
        System.out.println("Number of hits: " + localMapStats.getHits());
        System.out.println("Number of misses: " + localMapStats.getMisses());
        
        // Shutdown Hazelcast instance
        hazelcastInstance.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a Hazelcast instance and obtain a distributed map named "myMap". We then perform some operations on the map, such as putting and getting values. After that, we retrieve the LocalMapStats object using the `getLocalMapStats()` method and print out various statistics, such as the number of entries, puts, gets, hits, and misses.

By monitoring and analyzing these statistics, you can gain insights into the performance and behavior of your Hazelcast cluster. This information can be invaluable in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing your application, and improving the overall efficiency of your system.

To summarize, working with Hazelcast IMDG statistics in Java is a straightforward process. With just a few lines of code, you can access and utilize the statistics provided by Hazelcast to monitor and optimize your cluster's performance. This can greatly contribute to the success of your distributed caching and data storage solution.
