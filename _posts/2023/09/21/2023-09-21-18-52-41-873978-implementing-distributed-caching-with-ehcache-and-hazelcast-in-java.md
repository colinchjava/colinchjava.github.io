Caching is a powerful technique used to improve the performance and scalability of applications by storing frequently accessed data in memory. In a distributed environment, distributed caching becomes a crucial component to ensure data consistency and availability across multiple nodes.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement distributed caching using Ehcache and Hazelcast, two popular caching solutions for Java applications.

## What is Ehcache?

Ehcache is an open-source, high-performance, and scalable caching library for Java. It provides an easy-to-use API for caching data in memory, allowing quick access to frequently used data without hitting the database or expensive calculations.

## What is Hazelcast?

Hazelcast is an in-memory data grid platform that provides distributed data caching, clustering, and fault-tolerance capabilities. It allows you to distribute your cache across multiple nodes and ensures data consistency and availability even in the presence of failures.

## Setting up Ehcache and Hazelcast

To get started, make sure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.

1. Add the Ehcache and Hazelcast dependencies to your Maven project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.ehcache</groupId>
    <artifactId>ehcache</artifactId>
    <version>3.9.6</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>4.2</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Configure Ehcache to use Hazelcast as the distributed caching provider. Create a `ehcache.xml` file in your project's resources folder with the following content:

```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xmlns="http://www.ehcache.org/v3"
        xmlns:hz="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/cache"
        xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.ehcache.org/v3
           http://www.ehcache.org/schema/ehcache-core.xsd
           http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/cache
           http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/cache/hazelcast-cache-1.0.xsd">

    <cache alias="myCache">
        <expiry>
            <ttl unit="seconds">60</ttl>
        </expiry>
        <resources>
            <heap unit="entries">1000</heap>
        </resources>
        <hz:replicated-cache name="myCache"/>
    </cache>

    <hz:config xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config"
                xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config
                                    http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config/hazelcast-config-4.0.xsd">

        <hz:group name="myGroup">
            <hz:password>mySecretPassword</hz:password>
        </hz:group>
    </hz:config>

</config>
```

3. Create a Java class to interact with the distributed cache. Here's an example:

```java
import org.ehcache.Cache;
import org.ehcache.CacheManager;
import org.ehcache.config.builders.CacheManagerBuilder;

public class DistributedCacheExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating Ehcache CacheManager
        CacheManager cacheManager = CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManagerBuilder()
                .withCache("myCache", org.ehcache.config.builders.CacheConfigurationBuilder
                        .newCacheConfigurationBuilder(Long.class, String.class)
                        .build())
                .build();
        cacheManager.init();

        // Getting the cache
        Cache<Long, String> cache = cacheManager.getCache("myCache", Long.class, String.class);

        // Putting data into the cache
        cache.put(1L, "Cache value 1");

        // Getting data from the cache
        String cachedValue = cache.get(1L);
        System.out.println(cachedValue);

        // Closing the cache manager
        cacheManager.close();
    }
}
```

## Summary

In this blog post, we have learned how to implement distributed caching using Ehcache and Hazelcast in Java. We have set up Ehcache to use Hazelcast as the distributed caching provider, and seen an example of how to interact with the distributed cache.

Using distributed caching, you can significantly improve the performance and scalability of your Java applications by avoiding expensive database hits and calculations. Integrating Ehcache and Hazelcast provides a robust and reliable solution for implementing distributed caching in a distributed environment.
