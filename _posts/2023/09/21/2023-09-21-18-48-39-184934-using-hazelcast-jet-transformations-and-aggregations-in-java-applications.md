Hazelcast Jet is a fast and low-latency stream processing engine for big data processing and real-time analytics. It provides several powerful transformations and aggregations that can be leveraged in Java applications to process streaming data efficiently.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use Hazelcast Jet transformations and aggregations in Java applications.

## Transformations
Transformations in Hazelcast Jet allow you to modify, enrich, or filter the input data stream. Here are some commonly used transformations:

### Map
The `map` transformation applies a mapping function to each element in the input stream and produces a new stream of transformed elements. For example:

```java
StreamStage<String> input = pipeline.readFrom(source);
StreamStage<Integer> transformed = input.map(String::length);
```

### FlatMap
The `flatMap` transformation applies a mapping function to each element in the input stream and produces zero or more elements in the output stream. For example:

```java
StreamStage<String> input = pipeline.readFrom(source);
StreamStage<String> transformed = input.flatMap(str -> Arrays.asList(str.split(" ")).stream());
```

### Filter
The `filter` transformation applies a predicate to each element in the input stream and produces a stream of elements that satisfy the predicate. For example:

```java
StreamStage<Integer> input = pipeline.readFrom(source);
StreamStage<Integer> filtered = input.filter(num -> num % 2 == 0);
```

## Aggregations
Aggregations in Hazelcast Jet allow you to perform computations on the input stream and produce a summarized result. Here are some commonly used aggregations:

### Count
The `count` aggregation counts the number of elements in the input stream. For example:

```java
StreamStage<String> input = pipeline.readFrom(source);
StreamStage<Long> count = input.map(String::length).aggregate(AggregateOperations.count());
```

### Sum
The `sum` aggregation calculates the sum of elements in the input stream. For example:

```java
StreamStage<Integer> input = pipeline.readFrom(source);
StreamStage<Long> sum = input.aggregate(AggregateOperations.sum());
```

### Average
The `average` aggregation calculates the average of elements in the input stream. For example:

```java
StreamStage<Integer> input = pipeline.readFrom(source);
StreamStage<Double> average = input.aggregate(AggregateOperations.averagingDouble());
```

## Conclusion
Hazelcast Jet provides powerful transformations and aggregations that can be used to process streaming data in Java applications. By leveraging these features, developers can build efficient and scalable stream processing applications.
