When it comes to encrypting and decrypting data in Java, the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provides a comprehensive set of classes and APIs. Two important classes in the JCE are `CipherInputStream` and `CipherOutputStream`, which are used for seamlessly encrypting and decrypting data as it is read from or written to a stream.

## CipherInputStream

The `CipherInputStream` class in Java JCE is a subclass of `FilterInputStream` that applies a cryptographic transformation to the underlying stream's input. It takes an input stream and a `Cipher` object as parameters and provides an encrypted view of the data read from the underlying stream.

To create a `CipherInputStream`, you first need to create an instance of the `Cipher` class and initialize it in the desired encryption or decryption mode. Then, you provide the input stream and the initialized `Cipher` object to the `CipherInputStream` constructor.

Here's an example of using `CipherInputStream` to decrypt data from a file:

```java
try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("encrypted_data.txt");
    CipherInputStream cipherInputStream = new CipherInputStream(fileInputStream, cipher)) {

    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int bytesRead;

    while((bytesRead = cipherInputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
        // Process the decrypted data
        processData(buffer, bytesRead);
    }

} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## CipherOutputStream

Similarly, the `CipherOutputStream` class in Java JCE is a subclass of `FilterOutputStream` and applies a cryptographic transformation to the data being written to the underlying stream. It takes an output stream and a `Cipher` object as parameters and provides an encrypted view of the data being written.

To create a `CipherOutputStream`, you first need to create an instance of the `Cipher` class and initialize it in the desired encryption or decryption mode. Then, you provide the output stream and the initialized `Cipher` object to the `CipherOutputStream` constructor.

Here's an example of using `CipherOutputStream` to encrypt and write data to a file:

```java
try (FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("encrypted_data.txt", true);
    CipherOutputStream cipherOutputStream = new CipherOutputStream(fileOutputStream, cipher)) {

    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];

    // Read data to be encrypted from some source
    byte[] dataToEncrypt = getDataToEncrypt();

    // Encrypt and write the data to the stream
    cipherOutputStream.write(dataToEncrypt);

} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Conclusion

In Java JCE, the `CipherInputStream` and `CipherOutputStream` classes provide a convenient way to encrypt and decrypt data on the fly as it is being read from or written to a stream. These classes are essential for securing sensitive data and ensuring its confidentiality. By understanding how to use these classes effectively, you can confidently implement encryption and decryption functionality in your Java applications.
