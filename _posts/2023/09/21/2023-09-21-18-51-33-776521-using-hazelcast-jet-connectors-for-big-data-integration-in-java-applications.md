In today's world of big data, integrating and processing large amounts of data efficiently is crucial for businesses. One powerful tool for big data processing is Hazelcast Jet. Hazelcast Jet is an open-source, distributed stream processing engine that allows you to build real-time data pipelines and apply complex data transformations.

One of the key features of Hazelcast Jet is its extensive set of connectors that enable seamless integration with various data sources and sinks. These connectors provide an easy way to ingest data from different systems and work with them in your Java applications. In this blog post, we will explore some common Hazelcast Jet connectors and see how they can be used for big data integration.

## Kafka Connector

[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a popular distributed streaming platform that provides a reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant way to publish and subscribe to streams of records. The Kafka connector in Hazelcast Jet allows you to consume messages from Kafka topics and use them as a source of data for your Jet pipelines.

To use the Kafka connector, you need to add the following dependency to your Maven project:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast.jet.contrib</groupId>
    <artifactId>kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Once you have added the dependency, you can create a Kafka source like this:

```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(KafkaSources.kafka(topic, properties))
 .map(record -> record.value())
 .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
```

In the above code, `topic` represents the Kafka topic you want to consume from, and `properties` contains the Kafka configuration properties.

## JDBC Connector

[JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/) (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API for accessing relational databases. The JDBC connector in Hazelcast Jet allows you to read data from a database and use it as a source for your Jet pipelines.

To use the JDBC connector, you need to add the following dependency to your Maven project:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast.jet.contrib</groupId>
    <artifactId>jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Once you have added the dependency, you can create a JDBC source like this:

```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(JdbcSources.jdbc(connectionURL, query, rowMapper))
 .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
```

In the above code, `connectionURL` represents the JDBC connection URL for your database, `query` is the SQL query to fetch the data, and `rowMapper` is a function that maps each row of the result set to a Java object.

## Conclusion

Hazelcast Jet connectors provide a seamless way to integrate and process big data in your Java applications. Whether you need to consume data from Kafka or read data from a database using JDBC, Hazelcast Jet has you covered. By leveraging these connectors, you can build powerful and efficient data pipelines to analyze and transform large amounts of data.
