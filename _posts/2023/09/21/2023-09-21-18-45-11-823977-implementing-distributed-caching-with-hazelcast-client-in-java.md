#### Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Java programming language
- Maven or Gradle build tool

#### Setting up Hazelcast Client
To get started, we need to add the Hazelcast Client library as a dependency in our project.

If you are using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-client</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
implementation 'com.hazelcast:hazelcast-client:4.0.2'
```

After adding the dependency, you need to initialize the Hazelcast client in your Java code. Here's an example:

```java
import com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient;
import com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import com.hazelcast.core.IMap;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Hazelcast client configuration
        ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
        config.setClusterName("my-cluster");

        // Create a Hazelcast client instance
        HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(config);

        // Get a distributed map from the cluster
        IMap<String, String> cache = hazelcastInstance.getMap("my-cache");

        // Store a value in the distributed cache
        cache.put("key1", "value1");

        // Retrieve a value from the distributed cache
        String value = cache.get("key1");

        System.out.println("Retrieved value from cache: " + value);
        
        // Shutdown the Hazelcast client instance
        hazelcastInstance.shutdown();
    }
}
```

#### Conclusion
In this blog post, we learned how to implement distributed caching using the Hazelcast Client library in Java. We covered the basic setup and usage of Hazelcast client, including how to store and retrieve values from the distributed cache. Distributing your cache across multiple instances can greatly improve the performance and scalability of your applications. Hazelcast provides a simple and intuitive way to achieve this.
