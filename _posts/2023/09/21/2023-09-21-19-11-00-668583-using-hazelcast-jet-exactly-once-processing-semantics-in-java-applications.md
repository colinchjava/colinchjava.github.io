In distributed computing, achieving exactly-once processing is a fundamental requirement for data processing systems. Hazelcast Jet, an in-memory data processing engine, provides powerful capabilities to ensure exactly-once processing semantics in Java applications. In this article, we will explore how to utilize Hazelcast Jet to achieve exactly-once processing.

## What is exactly-once processing?

Exactly-once processing guarantees that each input record will be processed exactly once, even in the presence of failures or restarts. This means that even if there are system failures or network interruptions, the system will ensure that no duplicate processing occurs.

## How does Hazelcast Jet achieve exactly-once processing?

Hazelcast Jet leverages a combination of techniques and features to achieve exactly-once processing:

### 1. **Event-time Processing**: Hazelcast Jet incorporates event-time processing, which ensures that events are processed based on the time at which they actually occurred. This allows for consistent and deterministic processing regardless of the system's processing speed.

### 2. **Snapshotting**: Hazelcast Jet takes periodic snapshots of the computation state, capturing the state of all the involved processors. These snapshots are then used for restoring the computation in case of any failures or restarts. Using this mechanism, the system can guarantee that no duplicates are processed during recovery.

### 3. **Idempotent Data Sources**: Hazelcast Jet supports working with idempotent data sources, where duplicate records with the same unique identifier can be discarded during processing. This ensures that duplicate records do not disrupt the exactly-once processing semantics.

### 4. **Transaction Support**: Hazelcast Jet integrates with transactional resources, allowing for exactly-once processing when interacting with external systems. This ensures that the result of each processing step is consistently persisted and committed, preventing any inconsistencies or duplicates.

## Implementing exactly-once processing with Hazelcast Jet

To implement exactly-once processing with Hazelcast Jet, follow these steps:

1. Configure Hazelcast Jet in your Java application, setting up the necessary data sources, processors, and sinks.

2. Leverage the event-time processing capabilities of Hazelcast Jet by assigning event timestamps to the input data records. This ensures that records are processed based on their actual time rather than the system's processing time.

3. Enable snapshotting in Hazelcast Jet by defining appropriate snapshot intervals. This allows Hazelcast Jet to create periodic snapshots of the computation state, which are crucial for exactly-once processing.

4. Ensure that your data sources are idempotent. This can be achieved by using unique identifiers for each record and discarding duplicate records during processing.

5. If interacting with external systems, use Hazelcast Jet's transaction support to ensure consistent and exactly-once processing. This includes using transactional resources, such as databases, and handling failures or retries appropriately.

By following these steps and leveraging the capabilities of Hazelcast Jet, you can achieve exactly-once processing semantics in your Java applications.
