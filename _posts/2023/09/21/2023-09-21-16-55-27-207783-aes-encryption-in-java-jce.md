With increasing concerns about data security, encryption has become an essential part of most applications. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used encryption algorithm that provides strong protection for sensitive data. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform AES encryption in Java using the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE).

## What is JCE?

The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) is a set of Java API's that enable developers to build secure applications by providing cryptographic and encryption services. It includes a range of algorithms, including AES, RSA, DES, and more.

## AES Encryption Steps
To perform AES encryption in Java using JCE, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Import the Required Libraries**

First, we need to import the required libraries for AES encryption. In this case, we need to import the `javax.crypto` package.

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
```

**Step 2: Generate the AES Key**

Next, we need to generate the AES key that will be used for encryption and decryption. Here, we can use the `KeyGenerator` class to generate the key.

```java
KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
keyGenerator.init(128); // AES-128
SecretKey secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();
```

**Step 3: Create the Cipher Object**

Now, we need to create a `Cipher` object that will be used for encryption. We specify the transformation as `"AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"`.

```java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
```

**Step 4: Initialize the Cipher for Encryption**

To perform AES encryption, we need to initialize the cipher in encryption mode using the generated key.

```java
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
```

**Step 5: Perform Encryption**

To encrypt the data, we need to call the `doFinal` method of the `Cipher` object, passing in the data to be encrypted.

```java
byte[] encryptedData = cipher.doFinal(dataToEncrypt);
```

**Step 6: Perform Decryption (Optional)**

If you need to decrypt the data later, you can use the same process with the `Cipher` object initialized in decryption mode.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to perform AES encryption in Java using the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE). By following the steps outlined above, you can easily integrate AES encryption into your Java applications, ensuring secure transmission and storage of sensitive data. Remember to use strong encryption keys and follow recommended security best practices to ensure the integrity of your encrypted data.
