Publish-Subscribe messaging is a common pattern used in distributed systems to enable communication between multiple components. It allows publishers to send messages to a group of subscribers who are interested in receiving those messages. Hazelcast is a popular in-memory data grid that provides support for distributed pub-sub messaging. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement publish-subscribe messaging using Hazelcast in Java.

### Setting up Hazelcast

First, let's set up Hazelcast in our Java project. You can add the [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) dependency to your `pom.xml` file if you are using Maven, or include the JAR file in your project manually. Once you have Hazelcast set up, you can proceed with implementing the pub-sub messaging.

### Creating a Publisher

To implement the publisher, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a Hazelcast instance:

   ```java
   import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
   import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
   
   HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
   ```

2. Retrieve the topic to which you want to publish messages:

   ```java
   import com.hazelcast.core.ITopic;
   
   ITopic<String> topic = hazelcastInstance.getTopic("my-topic");
   ```

3. Publish messages to the topic:

   ```java
   String message = "Hello, subscribers!";
   topic.publish(message);
   ```

The publisher is now ready to send messages to the topic. Each message will be delivered to all subscribers of the topic.

### Creating a Subscriber

To implement the subscriber, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a Hazelcast instance:

   ```java
   import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
   import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
   
   HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
   ```

2. Retrieve the topic to which you want to subscribe:

   ```java
   import com.hazelcast.core.ITopic;
   
   ITopic<String> topic = hazelcastInstance.getTopic("my-topic");
   ```

3. Subscribe to the topic and define a callback to process the received messages:

   ```java
   topic.addMessageListener(message -> {
       String receivedMessage = message.getMessageObject();
       System.out.println("Received message: " + receivedMessage);
   });
   ```

The subscriber is now ready to receive messages published to the topic. Each message will be processed by the defined callback method.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement publish-subscribe messaging using Hazelcast in Java. By following the steps mentioned, you can set up a publisher to send messages and a subscriber to receive those messages. Hazelcast provides a reliable messaging system that can be easily integrated into your distributed systems architecture.
