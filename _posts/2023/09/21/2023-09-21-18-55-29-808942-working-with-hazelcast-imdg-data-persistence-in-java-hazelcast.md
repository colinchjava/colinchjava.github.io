Hazelcast IMDG (In-Memory Data Grid) is an open-source distributed computing platform that allows you to store and process large amounts of data in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for working with distributed data structures such as maps, queues, sets, and more.

One of the key features of Hazelcast IMDG is its ability to persist data to disk, ensuring data durability and availability even in the event of node failures or restarts. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with Hazelcast IMDG data persistence in Java.

## Enabling Data Persistence

To enable data persistence in Hazelcast IMDG, you need to configure the `MapConfig` to use a durable memory format and specify a store implementation that will handle reading and writing data to disk. Here's an example configuration:

```java
Config config = new Config();
MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig("myMap");

mapConfig.setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.NATIVE);
mapConfig.setBackupCount(1);  // Number of backups for each data partition
mapConfig.setAsyncBackupCount(0);  // Number of asynchronous backups
mapConfig.setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy.LRU);  // Eviction policy for the map

// Configure the MapStore implementation
mapConfig.setMapStoreConfig(new MapStoreConfig()
    .setImplementation(new MyMapStore())
    .setEnabled(true)
    .setWriteDelaysSeconds(0));  // Delay before writing changes to disk

HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
IMap<String, Object> myMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap("myMap");
```

In this example, we configure the `MapConfig` for the map named `"myMap"`. We set the `InMemoryFormat` to `NATIVE`, which stores entries as binary blobs in memory, and specify a backup count of 1, meaning each data partition will have one synchronous backup copy.

We then enable the `MapStore` by creating and configuring a `MapStoreConfig`. In this example, we use a custom implementation `MyMapStore`, which should extend `MapStore` and handle the reading and writing of data to a persistent storage.

## Implementing the MapStore

To implement a `MapStore` in Hazelcast IMDG, you need to extend the `MapStore` class and implement the required methods for loading, storing, and deleting data. Here's an example implementation:

```java
public class MyMapStore implements MapStore<String, Object> {

    @Override
    public Object load(String key) {
        // Implement logic to load data from the persistent storage
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> loadAll(Collection<String> keys) {
        // Implement logic to load multiple entries from the persistent storage
    }

    @Override
    public void store(String key, Object value) {
        // Implement logic to store the key-value pair in the persistent storage
    }

    @Override
    public void storeAll(Map<String, Object> map) {
        // Implement logic to store multiple key-value pairs in the persistent storage
    }

    @Override
    public void delete(String key) {
        // Implement logic to delete the key-value pair from the persistent storage
    }

    @Override
    public void deleteAll(Collection<String> keys) {
        // Implement logic to delete multiple entries from the persistent storage
    }
}
```

In the `load` and `loadAll` methods, you should implement the logic to retrieve the corresponding data from the persistent storage (e.g., a database, file system, etc.). Similarly, in the `store` and `storeAll` methods, you should implement the logic to write the data to the persistent storage. Finally, in the `delete` and `deleteAll` methods, you should implement the logic to remove the data from the persistent storage.

## Summary

Hazelcast IMDG provides built-in support for data persistence, allowing you to store and process large amounts of data in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner. By configuring a `MapStore` implementation and enabling the durable memory format, you can ensure data durability and availability even in the face of node failures or restarts.

By utilizing the power of Hazelcast IMDG's data persistence feature, you can build robust and scalable applications that can handle large workloads and provide reliable data access. Happy coding!
