## Prerequisites
To get started, make sure you have the following:
- NetBeans IDE installed on your machine
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed

## Setting up the Project
1. Open NetBeans and create a new Java project. You can do this by clicking on "File" > "New Project" and selecting "Java Application" from the options.
2. Give your project a name and choose a location to save it. Click "Finish" to create the project.

## Adding VR Libraries
1. Right-click on your project folder in NetBeans and select "Properties" from the context menu.
2. In the project properties window, navigate to the "Libraries" tab.
3. Click on the "Add Jar/Folder" button and browse to the location where you have the VR library files. Select the VR library files and click "Open" to add them to your project.

## Writing the VR Application Code
1. Create a new Java class inside your project. You can do this by right-clicking on your project folder and selecting "New" > "Java Class".
2. Give your class a name and click "Finish" to create the class.
3. Inside the class, import the necessary VR library classes using the `import` statement.

```java
import com.example.vrlibrary.VR;
```

4. Write the code for your VR application. You can use the VR library classes and methods to create and interact with the virtual environment.

```java
public class VRApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VR vr = new VR();
        vr.initialize();
        
        // Code to create and manipulate the virtual environment
        
        vr.render();
    }
}
```

## Running the VR Application
1. Right-click on your project folder and select "Run" from the context menu.
2. NetBeans will compile and execute your VR application. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the VR environment rendered on your screen.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to create VR applications using NetBeans. By adding the necessary VR libraries and writing the appropriate code, we can leverage the power of VR technology to create immersive and interactive experiences. Remember to test your VR application with different VR devices to ensure compatibility and a smooth user experience.
