# JFreeChart

**JFreeChart** is a powerful and widely-used open-source Java library for creating interactive charts and graphs. It supports a variety of chart types, including pie charts, bar charts, line charts, and more. To integrate JFreeChart into your NetBeans project, follow these steps:

1. Download the JFreeChart library from the official website or include it as a Maven dependency in your project.

```java
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jfree</groupId>
    <artifactId>jfreechart</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.3</version>
</dependency>
```

2. In NetBeans, right-click on your project and select "Properties."
3. In the properties dialog, click on the "Libraries" category.
4. Click on the "Add JAR/Folder" button and navigate to the JFreeChart JAR file you downloaded or added as a Maven dependency.
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

You can now start using JFreeChart to create stunning visualizations in your NetBeans project. Refer to the official JFreeChart documentation for examples and usage guidelines.

# Chart.js

**Chart.js** is a popular JavaScript library for creating beautiful and interactive charts directly in the browser. To integrate Chart.js into your NetBeans project, follow these steps:

1. Download the Chart.js library from the official website or include it as a CDN link in your HTML file.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
```

2. Create a new HTML file in your NetBeans project or open an existing one.
3. Add a canvas element in your HTML, which will serve as the container for your chart.

```html
<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
```

4. In your JavaScript file, initialize a new Chart object and provide the necessary data and options.

```javascript
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
        labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June'],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Sales',
            data: [120, 250, 180, 300, 200, 400],
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
            y: {
                beginAtZero: true
            }
        }
    }
});
```

You can customize the chart type, data, and various options according to your requirements. Chart.js provides an extensive list of configuration options and chart types to explore.

By integrating these data visualization libraries into your NetBeans projects, you can create visually appealing and insightful charts and graphs that enhance the overall user experience. Experiment with different chart types and explore the various customization options to create stunning visualizations that effectively communicate your data.
