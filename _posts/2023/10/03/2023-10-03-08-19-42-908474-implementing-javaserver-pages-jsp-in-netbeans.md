JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology that allows developers to create dynamic web pages using Java. It allows for the mixing of HTML and Java code, making it easier to create dynamic content.

In this tutorial, we will walkthrough the steps to create a JSP project in NetBeans and implement a simple JSP page.

## Prerequisites
- NetBeans IDE installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Java and HTML.

## Step 1: Creating a new JSP project
1. Open NetBeans IDE and click on "New Project" from the File menu.
2. In the New Project wizard, select "Java Web" category and choose "Web Application" as the project type. Click "Next".
3. Enter a project name and choose a project location. Click "Finish" to create the project.

## Step 2: Creating a JSP page
1. Right-click on the "Web Pages" folder in the project view and select "New" -> "JSP".
2. Enter a name for the JSP file, for example, "index.jsp". Click "Finish".
3. NetBeans will generate a basic JSP file with the HTML `DOCTYPE`, `html`, and `body` tags.

## Step 3: Adding dynamic content to the JSP
1. Within the `<body>` tags, you can add regular HTML content as well as JSP-specific tags.
2. To print the result of a Java expression, use the `<%= %>` syntax. For example: `<%= new java.util.Date() %>`.
3. You can also use JSP scriptlets to include Java code within `<% %>` tags. For example:
```java
<%
   String message = "Hello, JSP!";
   out.println(message);
%>
```
4. Save the changes to the JSP file.

## Step 4: Running the JSP page
1. Right-click on the project and select "Run" or press `F6` to run the project.
2. The JSP page will open in your default web browser, displaying the dynamic content.

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a JSP page in NetBeans. This is just a basic example, but with JSP, you can create more complex web applications by including database connections, servlets, and more.
