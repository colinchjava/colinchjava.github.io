## Setting Up a Debugging Session

To start debugging your Java application in NetBeans, you first need to set breakpoints in your code. Breakpoints are markers that tell the debugger to pause the execution of the program at a certain point. To set a breakpoint, simply click on the left margin of the line you want to pause on. You can also right-click on the line and select "Toggle Breakpoint".

Once you have set the breakpoints, you can start the debugging session by either clicking on the "Debug" button in the toolbar or by pressing `Ctrl + F5`. This will launch your application in debug mode.

## Debugging Features

1. **Step Over (F8):** This feature allows you to execute the current line and move to the next line. If the current line contains a method call, the debugger will execute the entire method and return to the calling line.

2. **Step Into (F7):** Use this feature to step into a method call on the current line. This allows you to dive into the details of the method and debug its implementation.

3. **Step Out (Shift + F8):** When you are inside a method and want to quickly move out of it, you can use the Step Out feature. This will execute the remaining lines in the current method and return to the caller.

4. **Resume (F5):** If you want to resume the execution of your program until the next breakpoint is encountered, you can use the Resume feature.

5. **Inspect Variables:** While debugging, you can inspect the values of variables at any point in your code. Simply hover over a variable to see its current value or add it to the Watch window to keep track of its changes.

6. **Evaluate Expression:** In addition to inspecting variables, you can also evaluate expressions during the debugging session. This can help you test certain conditions or calculate values on the fly.

## Conclusion

Java NetBeans provides a robust debugging environment that allows you to identify and fix issues in your code more efficiently. With its powerful features like breakpoints, step-by-step execution, variable inspection, and expression evaluation, you can gain valuable insights into your code's behavior during runtime.

So the next time you encounter a bug in your Java application, don't struggle to find the root cause manually. Instead, make use of the debugging capabilities offered by NetBeans to debug your code quickly and effectively.
