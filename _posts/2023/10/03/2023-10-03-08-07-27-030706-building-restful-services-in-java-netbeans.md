In today's interconnected world, building robust and secure RESTful services is a crucial skill for any developer. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build RESTful services using Java and NetBeans, a popular integrated development environment (IDE).

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following tools installed:

1. [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) - We will be using JDK 11 in this tutorial.
2. [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html) - Choose the Java SE version suitable for your operating system.

## Setting up the Project

1. Launch NetBeans IDE and create a new Java Web Application project: `File -> New Project -> Java Web -> Web Application`.
2. Specify the project name, location, and Java EE version (preferably 7 or higher).
3. Click "Finish" to create the project.

## Creating a RESTful Service

Now that we have set up the project, let's create our RESTful service.

1. Right-click on the project and select `New -> Java Class`.
2. Enter the class name for your RESTful service and click "Finish".
3. Inside the newly created class, create a method with the `@GET` annotation to handle GET requests.
   ```java
   @GET
   @Path("/hello")
   public String sayHello() {
       return "Hello, World!";
   }
   ```

## Testing the Service

To test the RESTful service, we need to deploy it on a local server.

1. Right-click on the project and select `Properties`.
2. Navigate to the `Run` tab and select a local server from the available options.
3. Click "OK" to save the changes.
4. Right-click on the project and choose `Run` to deploy the project on the selected server.

Once the project is deployed, we can test the service using a web browser or a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

Open your browser and enter the following URL: `http://localhost:{port}/your-app-context/rest/hello`.

The response should be "Hello, World!".

## Conclusion

Building RESTful services in Java with NetBeans is a straightforward process that enables you to create powerful and scalable applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can start building your own RESTful services and unlock the full potential of web development in Java.
