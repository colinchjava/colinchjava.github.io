NetBeans is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. It provides a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features that make writing and running Java programs quick and efficient. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of writing and running your first Java program in NetBeans.

## Step 1: Install NetBeans
Before we get started, make sure you have NetBeans installed on your computer. You can download it from the official NetBeans website (www.netbeans.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Step 2: Creating a New Java Project
1. Open NetBeans and click on "File" in the menu bar.
2. Select "New Project" from the dropdown menu.
3. In the New Project window, choose "Java" from the categories list and "Java Application" from the project list.
4. Click "Next" to proceed.

## Step 3: Setting Up the Project
1. In the "Project Name" field, give your project a name (e.g., "MyFirstProgram").
2. Choose the location where you want to save your project files.
3. Click "Finish" to create the project.

## Step 4: Writing Your First Java Program
1. On the left side of the NetBeans window, you will see the "Projects" tab. Expand the project tree by clicking on the arrow next to the project name.
2. Double-click on the "src" folder to open it.
3. Right-click on the package name (e.g., "com.myfirstprogram") and select "New" -> "Java Class" from the context menu.
4. Enter a class name (e.g., "MyFirstProgram") and make sure the "Create Main Class" checkbox is checked.
5. Click "Finish" to create the class.

## Step 5: Writing the Java Code
1. In the editor window, you will see the skeleton of your Java class with the `main` method already created for you.
2. 

```java
    public class MyFirstProgram {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
```

In the code above, we have a class named `MyFirstProgram` and a `main` method that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Step 6: Running Your Program
1. To run the program, click on the green arrow icon in the toolbar or right-click inside the editor window and select "Run File" from the context menu.
2. The output will be displayed in the Output window at the bottom of the NetBeans IDE, showing "Hello, World!".

Congratulations! You have successfully written and run your first Java program in NetBeans. This is just the beginning of your programming journey. With NetBeans, you can explore more Java concepts and build more complex applications. #java #NetBeans
