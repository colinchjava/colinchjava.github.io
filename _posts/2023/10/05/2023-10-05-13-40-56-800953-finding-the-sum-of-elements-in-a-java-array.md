In Java, an array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single data type. If you have an array and you want to find the sum of its elements, you can use a simple loop to iterate through the array and add up the values.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to find the sum of elements in a Java array:

```java
public class ArraySum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare and initialize an array
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

        // Initialize a variable to store the sum
        int sum = 0;

        // Iterate through the array and add up the values
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            sum += numbers[i];
        }

        // Print the sum
        System.out.println("The sum of the array elements is: " + sum);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have an array called `numbers` with five elements. We initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to store the sum of the array elements. Then, we use a `for` loop to iterate through the array and add each element to the `sum` variable.

Finally, we print the sum using the `System.out.println()` method.

To find the sum of elements in an array, you can modify the above code according to your specific requirements by changing the values in the `numbers` array or by using a different array altogether.

## Conclusion

Finding the sum of elements in a Java array is a common operation in programming. By using a loop to iterate through the array and adding up the values, you can easily calculate the sum. This concept can be applied to arrays of any size and datatype.
