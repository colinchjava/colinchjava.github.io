Sorting elements in an array is a common task in programming. Java provides different sorting algorithms through its built-in library that can be used to sort the elements in an array. In this article, we will explore how to sort elements in a Java array using the `Arrays` class.

## Using the `sort` method

In Java, the `Arrays` class provides a static method `sort` that can be used to sort an array of any type. The `sort` method internally uses a highly efficient sorting algorithm called "Dual-Pivot Quicksort" which has a time complexity of O(n log(n)), where n represents the number of elements in the array.

To sort an array using the `sort` method, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Arrays` class: 
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
```

2. Declare and initialize an array:
```java
int[] numbers = {4, 2, 9, 1, 5};
```

3. Call the `sort` method and pass the array as an argument:
```java
Arrays.sort(numbers);
```

4. The array will now be sorted in ascending order.

## Sorting in ascending order

To sort an array in ascending order, you can use the `Arrays.sort` method without any additional arguments. The method will sort the array in its natural order.

Here is an example of sorting an array in ascending order:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SortingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {4, 2, 9, 1, 5};
        
        Arrays.sort(numbers);
        
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
    }
}
```

Output:
```
[1, 2, 4, 5, 9]
```

## Sorting in descending order

If you want to sort an array in descending order, you can use the `Arrays.sort` method along with a custom `Comparator` that defines the sorting order.

Here is an example of sorting an array in descending order:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class SortingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] numbers = {4, 2, 9, 1, 5};
        
        Arrays.sort(numbers, Comparator.reverseOrder());
        
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
    }
}
```

Output:
```
[9, 5, 4, 2, 1]
```

## Conclusion

Sorting elements in a Java array is made easy by using the `Arrays` class. You can use the `sort` method to sort an array in ascending order, or by providing a custom `Comparator`, you can sort it in descending order. By understanding these techniques, you can manipulate and organize arrays to suit your specific program requirements efficiently.
