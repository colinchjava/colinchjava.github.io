To check if two arrays are equal in Java, you can make use of the `Arrays.equals()` method from the `java.util` package. This method compares the contents of two arrays and returns `true` if they are equal, and `false` otherwise.

Here is an example of how you can use the `Arrays.equals()` method to check if two arrays are equal:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArrayEquality {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] array2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] array3 = {1, 2, 3, 4};

        boolean result1 = Arrays.equals(array1, array2);
        boolean result2 = Arrays.equals(array1, array3);

        System.out.println("Array1 is equal to Array2: " + result1);
        System.out.println("Array1 is equal to Array3: " + result2);
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Array1 is equal to Array2: true
Array1 is equal to Array3: false
```

In the example above, we have three arrays: `array1`, `array2`, and `array3`. We use the `Arrays.equals()` method to compare `array1` with `array2` and `array3`. The results are then printed to the console.

Keep in mind that `Arrays.equals()` compares the elements of the arrays in the same order. If the order of elements is not important and you just want to check for set equality, you could sort the arrays and then compare them using the `Arrays.equals()` method.

By using the `Arrays.equals()` method, you can easily check the equality of two arrays in Java and make your code more efficient and readable.
