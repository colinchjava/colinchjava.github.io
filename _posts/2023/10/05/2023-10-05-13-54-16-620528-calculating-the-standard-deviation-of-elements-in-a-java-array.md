The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or variability of a set of values. In Java, you can calculate the standard deviation of elements in an array using the following steps:

1. Find the mean (average) of the array elements.
2. Calculate the square of the difference between each element and the mean.
3. Find the mean of the squared differences.
4. Take the square root of the mean of squared differences to get the standard deviation.

Let's write a Java code example that calculates the standard deviation of elements in an array:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArrayStandardDeviation {
    public static double calculateStandardDeviation(int[] array) {
        int sum = Arrays.stream(array).sum();
        double mean = (double) sum / array.length;

        double squaredDifferencesSum = Arrays.stream(array)
                .mapToDouble(num -> Math.pow((double) num - mean, 2))
                .sum();

        double meanOfSquaredDifferences = squaredDifferencesSum / array.length;

        return Math.sqrt(meanOfSquaredDifferences);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};

        double standardDeviation = calculateStandardDeviation(numbers);

        System.out.println("Standard Deviation: " + standardDeviation);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we define a `calculateStandardDeviation` method that takes an integer array as input and returns the standard deviation as a `double`. Inside the method, we use Java 8 streams to perform the necessary calculations step by step.

In the `main` method, we create an array of numbers `{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}` and calculate the standard deviation using the `calculateStandardDeviation` method. Finally, we print the result to the console.

With this code, you can easily calculate the standard deviation of elements in a Java array. Use this method in your applications whenever you need to measure the dispersion of a set of values.

# Conclusion

Calculating the standard deviation of elements in a Java array is a common statistical calculation. By following the steps mentioned above and using the provided Java code example, you can easily calculate the standard deviation of any given array. This metric helps in understanding the spread of values and assessing the variability of data.
