## The Traditional For Loop

The traditional for loop, also known as the for loop with a counter, allows us to iterate over an array by specifying the start and end conditions, as well as the increment or decrement value for the loop counter.

Let's take a look at an example of how to use a traditional for loop to iterate over a Java array:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("Element at index " + i + ": " + numbers[i]);
}
```

In this example, we have an array of integers named `numbers` containing the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The for loop iterates over the array by initializing the loop counter `i` to 0, checking if `i` is less than the length of the array (`numbers.length`), and incrementing `i` by 1 after each iteration.

Within the loop body, we can access each element of the array using the loop counter `i`. In this case, we simply print the element along with its index using `System.out.println()`.

The output of this code would be:

```
Element at index 0: 1
Element at index 1: 2
Element at index 2: 3
Element at index 3: 4
Element at index 4: 5
```

## Conclusion

Using a traditional for loop is a straightforward and efficient way to iterate over a Java array. By understanding how to initialize the loop counter, define the end condition, and specify the increment or decrement value, you can easily access and process each element of the array.

Remember to incorporate proper error handling and boundary checks when working with arrays to avoid any unexpected behaviors or exceptions.

Now that you have learned how to iterate over a Java array using a traditional for loop, you can apply this knowledge in your own projects and effectively manipulate arrays in your Java programs.
