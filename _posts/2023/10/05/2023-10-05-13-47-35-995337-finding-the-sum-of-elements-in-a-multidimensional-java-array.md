Working with multidimensional arrays is a common task in Java programming. One common operation is to find the sum of all the elements in a multidimensional array. In this tutorial, we will go through a step-by-step approach to calculate the sum of elements in a Java multidimensional array.

## Initializing a Multidimensional Array
To begin, we need to create and initialize a multidimensional array in Java. A multidimensional array is an array of arrays. It can be created by specifying the number of rows and columns.

Here's an example of initializing a 2-dimensional array with 3 rows and 4 columns:

```java
int[][] array = {{1, 2, 3, 4},
                 {5, 6, 7, 8},
                 {9, 10, 11, 12}};
```

## Calculating the Sum of Elements
The algorithm to calculate the sum of elements in a multidimensional array involves iterating through each element of the array and adding it to a running total.

Here's a step-by-step approach to calculate the sum:

1. Create a variable to store the sum, initialized to 0.
2. Use nested `for` loops to iterate through each element of the array.
3. In each iteration, add the current element to the sum.
4. Finally, return the sum.

Here's an example of a method that calculates the sum of elements in a multidimensional array:

```java
public static int calculateSum(int[][] array) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < array[i].length; j++) {
            sum += array[i][j];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

## Example Code
Let's put everything together and run an example to calculate the sum of elements in a multidimensional array:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] array = {{1, 2, 3, 4},
                         {5, 6, 7, 8},
                         {9, 10, 11, 12}};
        int sum = calculateSum(array);
        System.out.println("Sum of elements: " + sum);
    }
    
    public static int calculateSum(int[][] array) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < array[i].length; j++) {
                sum += array[i][j];
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Sum of elements: 78
```

By following this approach, you can easily calculate the sum of elements in a multidimensional Java array. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as calculating the total score in a 2D game or computing the average of a set of values.
