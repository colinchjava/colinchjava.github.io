In Java, an array is a fixed-size data structure that holds a collection of elements of the same type. There are several ways to iterate over an array, and one of the simplest methods is by using the enhanced for loop.

The enhanced for loop, also known as the for-each loop, was introduced in Java 5. It provides a more concise way to iterate over arrays and other iterable objects without the need for an index variable.

To iterate over a Java array using an enhanced for loop, follow these steps:

1. Declare the array and initialize it with elements:
    ```java
    String[] names = {"John", "Jane", "Alice", "Bob"};
    ```

2. Use the enhanced for loop to iterate over the array:
    ```java
    for (String name : names) {
        // Do something with the name
        System.out.println(name);
    }
    ```

In the code above, we have an array of strings called `names` that contains four elements. We use the enhanced for loop to iterate over the array, assigning each element to the variable `name` in each iteration. Inside the loop, we can perform any desired operations on each element.

In this example, we simply print each name to the console, but you can perform any operations you need, such as data processing or calculations.

The enhanced for loop is particularly useful when you only need to iterate over the elements of an array and don't require the index of each element. It provides a cleaner and more readable alternative to traditional for loops.

One thing to note is that the enhanced for loop is read-only, meaning you cannot modify the elements of the array within the loop. If you need to modify the elements, you would need to use a traditional for loop instead.

That's it! You now know how to iterate over a Java array using the enhanced for loop. It's a simple and efficient way to traverse through an array and perform operations on its elements.
