```java
public class ArrayEmptyCheck {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = new int[0];

        if (numbers.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Array is empty");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Array is not empty");
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create an empty array called `numbers` with a length of 0. To check if the array is empty, we use the `length` property of the array and compare it to 0. If the length is 0, it means the array is empty.

Note that when working with arrays, it's important to initialize them with the appropriate length to avoid unexpected behavior. In the example above, we explicitly create an array with a length of 0 to demonstrate an empty array scenario.

Checking if an array is empty is a simple and useful routine in Java programming. By using the `length` property, you can quickly determine whether an array contains any elements or not.
