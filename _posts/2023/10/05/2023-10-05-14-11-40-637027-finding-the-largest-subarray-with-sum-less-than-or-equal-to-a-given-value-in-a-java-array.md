## Introduction to the Problem {#introduction}
Given an array of integers and a target value, we need to find the length of the largest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to the target value.

For example, given the array {2, 4, 5, 8, 10} and target value 15, the subarray with the largest sum less than or equal to 15 is {2, 4, 5, 8}, and its length is 4.

## Approach {#approach}
To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window technique. We will maintain two pointers, `start` and `end`, that define the current subarray. We will also keep track of the current sum of the subarray.

1. Initialize `start` and `end` pointers to the beginning of the array.
2. Initialize `maxLen` to 0, which will store the length of the largest subarray.
3. Iterate over the array while the `end` pointer is less than the array length.
    4. Calculate the current sum of the subarray from `start` to `end`.
    5. If the sum is less than or equal to the target value and the length of the current subarray is greater than `maxLen`, update `maxLen`.
    6. If the sum is greater than the target value, move the `start` pointer to the right to shrink the subarray.
    7. Move the `end` pointer to the right to expand the subarray.
8. Return `maxLen` as the length of the largest subarray.

## Implementation in Java {#implementation}
Here's the Java code implementing the above approach:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLargestSubarray(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;

        while (end < nums.length) {
            currentSum += nums[end];

            while (currentSum > target) {
                currentSum -= nums[start];
                start++;
            }

            if (currentSum <= target) {
                int currentLen = end - start + 1;
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, currentLen);
            }

            end++;
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
By using the sliding window technique, we can efficiently find the largest subarray in a Java array whose sum is less than or equal to a given target value. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.

In this blog post, we discussed the problem, the approach, and provided an implementation in Java. Feel free to use this code as a reference for your own projects.
