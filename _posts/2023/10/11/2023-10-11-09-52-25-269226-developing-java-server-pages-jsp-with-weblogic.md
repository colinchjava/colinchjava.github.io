Java Server Pages (JSP) is a technology that allows developers to dynamically generate HTML, XML or other types of web pages in response to client requests. In this blog post, we will explore how to develop JSP applications using Oracle WebLogic Server.

## Setting up WebLogic Server

Before we can start developing JSP applications, we need to set up WebLogic Server. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Download and install the latest version of Oracle WebLogic Server from the Oracle website.
2. Configure a new domain for your application.
3. Start the WebLogic Server.

## Creating a JSP Project

Once the server is up and running, we can create a new JSP project. Follow these steps to create a new JSP project:

1. Open your favorite IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.
2. Create a new Dynamic Web Project.
3. Configure the project by specifying the WebLogic Server runtime and the project name.
4. Finish the project creation process.

## Writing JSP Code

Now that we have our project set up, we can start writing JSP code. JSP allows you to mix HTML and Java code, making it a powerful tool for dynamic web page generation.

Here is an example of a simple JSP page:

```jsp
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My JSP Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <% 
        String message = "Hello, World!";
        out.println(message);
    %>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we define a JSP page that outputs the message "Hello, World!" to the browser. The `<%@ page %>` directive is used to specify the page attributes, while the `<% %>` scriptlet tags allow us to embed Java code.

## Deploying and Running the JSP Application

Once we have finished writing our JSP code, we need to deploy and run the application on WebLogic Server. Follow these steps to deploy and run the JSP application:

1. Right-click on the project and select "Run on Server" or "Deploy to WebLogic Server" depending on your IDE.
2. Choose the target WebLogic Server to deploy the application.
3. Wait for the deployment process to complete.
4. Access the application by entering the URL in a web browser.

Congratulations! You have successfully developed and deployed a JSP application using WebLogic Server.

Throughout this blog post, we learned how to set up WebLogic Server, create a JSP project, write JSP code, and deploy and run the application. JSP is a powerful technology that allows for dynamic web page generation, and WebLogic Server provides a robust environment for hosting JSP applications.
