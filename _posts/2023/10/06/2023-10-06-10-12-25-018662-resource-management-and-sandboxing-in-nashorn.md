Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that is part of the Java SE platform. It allows you to execute JavaScript code within your Java applications. In addition to providing the ability to run JavaScript, Nashorn also offers resource management and sandboxing features, which help ensure the secure and efficient execution of JavaScript code.

## Resource Management

When executing JavaScript code in Nashorn, it is important to handle resources such as files, network connections, and database connections properly. Mishandling resources can lead to resource leaks and degrade performance.

To effectively manage resources in Nashorn, you should use try-with-resources statements to ensure that resources are properly closed and released. For example, when opening a file, you can use the `FileReader` and `FileWriter` classes from the Java API, and wrap them in a try-with-resources block:

```java
try(FileReader reader = new FileReader("file.txt");
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt")) {
    // Perform operations on the file
} catch(IOException e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

By using try-with-resources, the file readers and writers will be automatically closed at the end of the block, even if an exception occurs. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures efficient resource management.

## Sandboxing

Nashorn provides sandboxing capabilities to isolate and restrict the execution of JavaScript code. Sandboxing is useful when executing untrusted or potentially unsafe JavaScript code, as it prevents the code from accessing sensitive data or resources.

To create a sandbox environment in Nashorn, you can use the `ScriptEngineManager` and `ScriptEngine` classes from the Nashorn API. Here's an example of how to create a sandboxed environment:

```java
import javax.script.*;

public class SandboxExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("nashorn");

        // Create a new sandboxed context
        engine.getContext().setSecurityDomain(null);

        // Execute JavaScript code in sandbox
        String script = "print('Hello, World!');";
        engine.eval(script);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `setSecurityDomain(null)` method call sets the security domain to null, effectively creating a sandbox where the JavaScript code is restricted from accessing any Java objects or resources. This helps prevent potential security risks from running untrusted code.

Remember to use sandboxing cautiously and restrict the privileges of the sandboxed environment to minimize any potential risks.

## Conclusion

Nashorn provides resource management and sandboxing features that help ensure the secure and efficient execution of JavaScript code within Java applications. By properly managing resources and utilizing sandboxing, you can enhance the reliability and security of your Nashorn-powered applications.
