Nashorn is a JavaScript engine provided by Oracle that allows you to run JavaScript code on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When writing JavaScript code for Nashorn, it is essential to have proper debugging techniques in place to identify and fix any issues that may arise.

In this blog post, we will explore some useful tips and techniques for debugging JavaScript code in Nashorn.

### Enabling debugging

By default, Nashorn does not enable debugging. To enable debugging mode in Nashorn, you need to pass the `--inspect` flag when invoking the `jjs` command-line tool.

```bash
jjs --inspect script.js
```

This will start Nashorn in debugging mode and listen for incoming connections on the default port 9229.

### Using print statements

One of the simplest ways to debug JavaScript code in Nashorn is by using print statements to output values or log messages to the console. You can use the `print` function provided by Nashorn to achieve this.

```javascript
print("Debug message: ", variable);
```

Print statements can help you track the flow of your code and identify the values of variables at various points in your script.

### Using the Java debugger

Nashorn being a JavaScript engine running on the JVM, you can also leverage the Java debugger to step through your JavaScript code. To do this, you will need to attach a remote debugger to the Nashorn process.

```bash
jjs --jdb script.js
```

This will start Nashorn and pause the execution, waiting for a Java debugger to attach. You can then use your preferred Java debugger (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) to attach to the Nashorn process and debug your JavaScript code just like any Java application.

### Using breakpoints

Another powerful debugging technique is to set breakpoints in your JavaScript code. Breakpoints allow you to pause the execution at specific lines of code, giving you the opportunity to inspect variables and step through your script.

To set a breakpoint, you can use the `debugger` keyword in your JavaScript code.

```javascript
// Some JavaScript code
debugger; // Set breakpoint here
```

When Nashorn encounters the `debugger` statement during execution, it will pause and wait for further instructions from the debugger.

### Inspecting variables and objects

Once you have paused the execution of your JavaScript code, you can inspect the values of variables and objects to understand their state and identify any issues.

Most Java debuggers provide a Variables panel where you can see the values of variables currently in scope. You can also inspect various properties and methods of objects and drill down into their values.

### Conclusion

Debugging JavaScript code in Nashorn can be made more efficient with the use of proper techniques and tools. Enabling debugging, using print statements, leveraging the Java debugger, setting breakpoints, and inspecting variables will help you track down and fix any issues in your JavaScript code.

Remember to follow these techniques whenever you encounter problems in your Nashorn JavaScript applications for a smoother debugging experience.
