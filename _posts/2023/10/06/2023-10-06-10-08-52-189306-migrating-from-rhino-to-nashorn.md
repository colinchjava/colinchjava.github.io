In this blog post, we will explore the process of migrating from the Rhino JavaScript engine to Nashorn in your Java projects. Rhino, developed by Mozilla, has been the go-to JavaScript engine for Java applications for a long time. However, with the introduction of Nashorn in Java 8, it is recommended to transition to Nashorn for improved performance and compatibility with newer JavaScript language features.

## What is Nashorn?

Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that is developed as part of the OpenJDK project. It provides a seamless integration of JavaScript with Java, allowing developers to execute JavaScript code within Java applications. Nashorn offers performance improvements over Rhino, thanks to its support for the invokedynamic bytecode instruction introduced in Java 7.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Review Rhino Specific Features

Before diving into the migration, it is important to review any Rhino-specific features or APIs that your application might be using. Make note of any customizations, dependencies, or third-party libraries that rely on Rhino. This step will help you identify potential areas that may require additional effort during the migration process.

### Step 2: Update Dependencies and Environment

To migrate to Nashorn, you will need to update your project dependencies and environment. 

- **Update Java Version**: Ensure that your project is using Java 8 or above, as Nashorn is included in the standard Java distribution starting from Java 8.
- **Upgrade Libraries**: Identify any third-party libraries or frameworks that have changed their API or require specific modifications for Nashorn compatibility. Update these libraries to their latest versions that are compatible with Nashorn.

### Step 3: Modify Rhino-Specific Code

Next, you need to modify any code that directly depends on Rhino-specific features or APIs. Nashorn provides a similar API to Rhino, but there might be some differences in behavior or syntax. Here are some common modifications you may need to make:

- **Script Engine Initialization**: Instead of using `new org.mozilla.javascript.ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("rhino")`, use the following line to initialize Nashorn: `new javax.script.ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn")`.
- **Standard JavaScript Functions**: There might be slight differences in how certain JavaScript functions behave in Nashorn compared to Rhino. It's recommended to review the Nashorn documentation to understand any discrepancies and make necessary adjustments.

### Step 4: Performance Optimization

One of the main advantages of migrating to Nashorn is improved performance. However, to fully utilize this advantage, you may need to make additional optimizations, such as:

- **Using Compiled Scripts**: Nashorn allows scripts to be compiled into Java bytecode, resulting in faster execution. Consider compiling frequently used scripts for optimal performance.
- **Leveraging Nashorn-specific Features**: Nashorn introduces additional features, such as the ability to call Java code directly from JavaScript. This can eliminate the need for certain complex workarounds used in Rhino. Evaluate your codebase for opportunities to leverage these features.

## Conclusion

Migrating from Rhino to Nashorn can bring significant performance improvements and compatibility with modern JavaScript language features. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can successfully transition your Java projects to Nashorn and enjoy the benefits offered by this powerful JavaScript engine.
