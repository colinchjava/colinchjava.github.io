## Introduction to Nashorn
Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that provides a seamless integration between Java and JavaScript. It allows you to execute JavaScript code directly within your Java application, leveraging the power and flexibility of both languages.

## Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze and interpret data points collected over time. It is commonly used in various domains, such as finance, economics, and weather forecasting, to identify patterns, trends, and underlying relationships in the data.

## Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting is a subset of time series analysis that focuses on predicting future data points based on historical patterns and trends. It is useful for making informed decisions and planning future actions based on the expected values of the time series data.

## Using Nashorn for Time Series Analysis
Nashorn can be utilized for time series analysis and forecasting by leveraging its ability to execute JavaScript code. JavaScript has a wide range of libraries and tools available for time series analysis, such as stats.js and timeseries-analysis.

To use Nashorn for time series analysis, you can write your JavaScript code within your Java application and execute it using the Nashorn engine. You can access the time series data from your Java code and pass it to the JavaScript functions for analysis and forecasting. Additionally, you can also utilize the Java libraries for data manipulation and visualization, further enhancing your time series analysis capabilities.

Below is an example code snippet showcasing how Nashorn can be used for time series analysis:

```javascript
// Load the time series data from Java
var data = Java.from(javaData);

// Perform time series analysis using JavaScript libraries
var analysisResult = stats.timeSeriesAnalysis(data);

// Perform time series forecasting
var forecast = timeseries.forecast(analysisResult, 10);

// Pass the forecasted data back to Java
Java.to(forecast, javaForecast);
```

In the above example, the `javaData` is the time series data passed from the Java code, and `javaForecast` is the variable in which the forecasted data will be stored and passed back to Java.

## Conclusion
Nashorn provides a powerful and efficient way to perform time series analysis and forecasting within your Java applications. By leveraging JavaScript libraries for time series analysis and integrating them with Java, you can harness the capabilities of both languages to gain valuable insights from your time series data.

Using Nashorn for time series analysis and forecasting allows you to take advantage of the rich JavaScript ecosystem while benefiting from the robustness and scalability of Java. With this combination, you can unlock new possibilities for advanced data analysis and prediction in your applications.
