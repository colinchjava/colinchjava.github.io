Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that comes bundled with Java 8 and later versions. It allows you to embed JavaScript code within your Java applications and execute it seamlessly. While Nashorn is powerful out of the box, there are certain use cases where fine-tuning it can lead to better performance and enhanced capabilities. In this blog post, we will explore a few techniques to fine-tune Nashorn for specific use cases.

## Use case 1: Optimize memory usage

Nashorn maintains an internal heap to store JavaScript objects and functions. By default, it uses a fixed heap size of 10MB. However, for memory-intensive use cases, this default size may not be sufficient.

To optimize memory usage, you can increase the heap size by setting the `nashorn.args` system property. For example, to set the heap size to 100MB, you can use the following command line argument when running your Java application:

```java
java -Dnashorn.args=--persistent-code-cache-size=100M MyApp
```

By adjusting the heap size according to your specific use case, you can avoid potential out-of-memory errors and improve the overall performance of Nashorn.

## Use case 2: Improve performance

Nashorn provides a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that dynamically translates JavaScript code to highly optimized machine code. By default, the JIT compilation is enabled, but you can fine-tune its behavior to further improve performance.

One option is to adjust the compilation threshold, which determines when to trigger JIT compilation. By lowering the threshold, Nashorn will start compiling JavaScript code earlier, potentially improving performance at the cost of increased startup time. You can set the threshold using the `nashorn.args` system property:

```java
java -Dnashorn.args=--optimistic-types=true,--compile-threshold=1000 MyApp
```

Experimenting with different threshold values can help you find the optimal balance between startup time and runtime performance.

## Use case 3: Extend the standard library

Nashorn supports adding custom Java classes and functions to the JavaScript environment. This can be useful when you need to extend the standard library with additional functionality.

To add custom classes or functions, you can use the `ScriptEngine` API provided by Nashorn. For example, to add a custom `Utils` class to the JavaScript environment, you can do the following:

```java
ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");
engine.eval("function Utils() {\n  this.square = function(x) { return x * x; }\n}");
```

Once added, you can use the `Utils` class within your JavaScript code:

```javascript
var utils = new Utils();
var result = utils.square(5);
print(result); // Output: 25
```

By extending the standard library with custom functionality, you can tailor Nashorn to better suit your specific use case.

## Conclusion

By fine-tuning Nashorn for specific use cases, you can optimize memory usage, improve performance, and extend its capabilities. Whether you need to process large amounts of data, achieve better execution speed, or add custom functionality, these techniques can help you get the most out of Nashorn's JavaScript engine within your Java applications.
