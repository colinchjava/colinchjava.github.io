## What is Java Nashorn? {#what-is-java-nashorn}

Java Nashorn is a JavaScript engine introduced in Java 8. It allows developers to embed JavaScript code within their Java applications and run it using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It provides seamless integration between Java and JavaScript, making it easier to work with JavaScript within Java projects. Nashorn is recommended as a replacement for the aging Rhino JavaScript engine.

## Installation Steps {#installation-steps}

Follow the steps below to set up and install Java Nashorn on your system.

### Step 1: Download JDK {#step-1-download-jdk}

The first step is to download the Java Development Kit (JDK) that includes the Nashorn JavaScript engine. The JDK is available for free from the Oracle website. Visit the Oracle JDK download page ([https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)) and download the appropriate JDK version for your operating system.

### Step 2: Install JDK {#step-2-install-jdk}

Once you have downloaded the JDK installer, run the installer and follow the instructions to install the JDK on your system. Make sure to choose the appropriate installation directory and accept the license agreement.

### Step 3: Verify Installation {#step-3-verify-installation}

After the installation is complete, you can verify if the JDK and Nashorn are installed correctly. Open a command prompt or terminal and type the following command to check the Java version:

```
java -version
```

If the installation was successful, you should see the Java version and other details. To verify if Nashorn is installed, type the following command:

```
jjs -version
```

If Nashorn is installed, you should see the version information displayed in the terminal.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and installed Java Nashorn on your system. You are now ready to use Nashorn to execute JavaScript code within your Java applications.
