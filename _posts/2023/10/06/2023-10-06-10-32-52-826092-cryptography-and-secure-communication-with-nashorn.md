## Introduction to Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of securing communication by converting plain text into unreadable ciphertext. It involves various techniques such as encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and hashing algorithms. 

## Using Nashorn for Cryptography

With Nashorn, we can leverage the power of JavaScript to implement cryptographic algorithms within our Java applications. Nashorn provides APIs to interact with cryptographic libraries such as the popular CryptoJS.

Let's take a look at an example of how to use Nashorn with CryptoJS in Java:

```java
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class CryptoExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");
        engine.eval("load('crypto-js.js');");
        engine.eval("var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt('secret message', 'password');");
        engine.eval("print('Encrypted Message: ' + encrypted.toString());");
    }
}
```

In the above example, we load the `crypto-js.js` library using `load()`. Then, we encrypt the message 'secret message' using the AES algorithm and a provided password. Finally, we print the encrypted message.

## Implementing Secure Communication

To establish secure communication between two parties, we can utilize cryptography to encrypt and decrypt the data being exchanged. Nashorn can help us achieve this by implementing cryptographic algorithms.

Here's an example of how to implement secure communication in Java using Nashorn:

```java
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class SecureCommunicationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ScriptException {
        ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("nashorn");
        engine.eval("load('crypto-js.js');");
        
        String message = "Hello, Bob!";
        String publicKey = "BobPublicKey";
        String privateKey = "AlicePrivateKey";
        
        engine.eval("var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt('" + message + "', '" + publicKey + privateKey + "');");
        
        String encryptedMessage = (String) engine.eval("encrypted.toString()");
        System.out.println("Encrypted Message: " + encryptedMessage);
    }
}
```

In the example above, we encrypt the message "Hello, Bob!" using the AES algorithm and the public and private keys of the sender and receiver. The encrypted message is then printed to the console.

## Conclusion

With the help of Nashorn, we can leverage JavaScript's extensive cryptography libraries to implement secure communication in our Java applications. By encrypting and decrypting messages, we can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of our communication channels.
