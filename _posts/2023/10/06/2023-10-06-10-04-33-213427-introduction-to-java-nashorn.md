Java Nashorn is a lightweight JavaScript runtime engine that was introduced in Java 8. It allows you to execute JavaScript code within your Java applications, making it a powerful tool for incorporating JavaScript functionality into your Java projects.

## Why Use Java Nashorn?

Using Java Nashorn has several benefits:

1. **Seamless Integration**: You can seamlessly integrate JavaScript code with your existing Java codebase, allowing you to leverage the power and flexibility of JavaScript in your Java applications.

2. **Performance**: Nashorn provides excellent performance by using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. It compiles JavaScript code into Java bytecode, enabling efficient execution.

3. **Access to Java APIs**: Nashorn allows you to easily access Java APIs from JavaScript, making it easier to utilize Java libraries and frameworks.

4. **Polyglot Support**: Nashorn supports multiple scripting languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. This makes it a versatile tool for developing applications that require interoperability between different languages.

## Getting Started with Java Nashorn

To start using Nashorn, follow these steps:

1. **Import Nashorn Libraries**: Nashorn is included in the Java Development Kit (JDK), so you don't need to add any additional dependencies to your project.

2. **Create a JavaScript Engine**: Obtaining a JavaScript engine instance is the first step in executing JavaScript code. You can create a new instance of the `ScriptEngine` class using the `ScriptEngineManager` class:

```java
import javax.script.*;

public class NashornExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("nashorn");
        
        // Write your JavaScript code here
        
        // Execute JavaScript code
        
    }
}
```

3. **Write JavaScript Code**: Once you have the JavaScript engine instance, you can write your JavaScript code within the `main` method:

```java
String javascriptCode = "\"Hello, Nashorn!\"";
engine.eval("print(" + javascriptCode + ")");
```

4. **Execute JavaScript Code**: Finally, you can execute the JavaScript code by calling the `eval` method on the `ScriptEngine` instance:

```java
engine.eval("print(" + javascriptCode + ")");
```

## Conclusion

Java Nashorn provides a seamless way to integrate JavaScript into your Java applications. It offers excellent performance, access to Java APIs, and support for multiple scripting languages. By incorporating Nashorn into your projects, you can take advantage of the power and flexibility of JavaScript within the Java ecosystem.
