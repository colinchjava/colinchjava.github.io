Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that is included in Java 8 and later versions. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). While Nashorn provides great interoperability between Java and JavaScript, it is important to optimize the performance of your JavaScript code for better execution.

In this article, we will explore some performance optimizations techniques that can be applied to Nashorn code to improve its execution speed.

## 1. Avoiding Global Variables

Global variables can slow down the execution of JavaScript code, especially in Nashorn. It is recommended to limit the use of global variables and instead, use local variables within functions or modules. This helps reduce the time spent in variable lookup.

```javascript
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
  var tax = 0.1; // Local variable
  var total = price * quantity * (1 + tax);
  return total;
}
```

## 2. Using Strict Mode

Enabling strict mode in JavaScript provides additional checks and optimizations that can lead to improved performance. Strict mode helps catch common coding mistakes and enforces stricter adherence to JavaScript syntax rules.

To enable strict mode in Nashorn, add the following directive to the top of your JavaScript file or function:

```javascript
"use strict";
```

## 3. Caching Function References

When invoking a function repeatedly in Nashorn, caching the function reference can improve performance. This avoids the overhead of repeatedly accessing the function object.

```javascript
var myFunc = function() {
  // Function body
};

for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  myFunc(); // Invoking function
}
```

## 4. Using Typed Arrays

Nashorn supports typed arrays, which provide better performance when working with large amounts of numerical data. Typed arrays allow direct manipulation of binary data, which can be faster and more memory-efficient than regular JavaScript arrays.

```javascript
var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1024); // Allocate buffer
var uint8Array = new Uint8Array(buffer); // Typed array

// Manipulate binary data
uint8Array[0] = 255;
```

## 5. Minimizing String Concatenation

String concatenation in Nashorn can be a costly operation, especially when performed repeatedly. Instead of using the concatenation operator (+), consider using an array and then joining the elements using the `Array.prototype.join` method.

```javascript
var str = '';
for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  str += 'Hello '; // Avoid excessive string concatenation
}
```

## Conclusion

By applying these performance optimization techniques in your Nashorn code, you can significantly improve the execution speed of your JavaScript code running on the JVM. Remember to profile your code to identify any bottlenecks and evaluate the impact of the optimizations applied.

Make sure to analyze and make necessary adjustments to your code to achieve the best performance results.
