## Introduction to Nashorn

Nashorn, introduced in Java 8, allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the JVM. It provides seamless integration with Java libraries and tools, opening up a world of possibilities for building robust applications. With Nashorn, you can leverage the power of JavaScript while taking advantage of the mature Java ecosystem.

## Building Cloud-Native Applications

To build cloud-native applications with Nashorn, you can utilize its rich scripting capabilities to write microservices, event-driven workflows, and serverless functions. Nashorn's support for modularization and dependency management allows for easy integration with other Java components and libraries.

Moreover, Nashorn's lightweight nature makes it an ideal choice for developing serverless functions, which can be scaled independently in a cloud-native environment. By harnessing the power of Nashorn, you can quickly build and deploy serverless functions that respond to events and provide seamless integration with other cloud services.

## Deploying with Kubernetes

Kubernetes, with its declarative configuration and robust API, provides an efficient way to manage containerized applications at scale. To deploy a Nashorn-based application on Kubernetes, you can containerize your application using Docker and define the necessary Kubernetes manifests.

With Kubernetes, you can effortlessly scale your application depending on the workload, manage service discovery and load balancing, and monitor the health of your application. Kubernetes also offers features such as auto-scaling, rolling updates, and fault tolerance, ensuring the smooth operation of your cloud-native application.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored the potential of using Nashorn and Kubernetes to build and deploy cloud-native applications. Nashorn's ability to execute JavaScript on the JVM provides developers with the flexibility to leverage their existing Java knowledge while embracing the power of JavaScript. When combined with Kubernetes, you can easily scale and manage your applications in a resilient and efficient manner.

By harnessing the capabilities of Nashorn and Kubernetes, you can unlock endless possibilities for building cloud-native applications that are scalable, resilient, and optimized for the modern cloud-centric world.
