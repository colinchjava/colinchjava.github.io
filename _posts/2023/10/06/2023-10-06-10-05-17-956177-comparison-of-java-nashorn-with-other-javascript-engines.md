In the world of Java development, sometimes there is a need to run JavaScript code within a Java application. This can be due to various reasons, such as the need for custom scripting or dynamic behavior in Java applications. To fulfill this need, developers have a few options for integrating JavaScript into their Java code. In this article, we will specifically compare Java Nashorn with some other popular JavaScript engines.

## What is Java Nashorn?
Java Nashorn is a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript engine that was introduced in Java 8. It is built on top of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and provides seamless integration between Java and JavaScript. Nashorn allows developers to write and execute JavaScript code within a Java application, making it a suitable choice for scenarios that require scripting capabilities.

## Comparison with Rhino
Rhino is another JavaScript engine for Java, which has been in existence for a longer period of time compared to Nashorn. It was initially developed by Netscape and is widely used in various Java applications. Here are some points of comparison between Nashorn and Rhino:

- **Performance**: Nashorn performs significantly better than Rhino in terms of speed and memory consumption. This is due to the fact that Nashorn is built on newer technologies and utilizes the capabilities of the JVM more effectively.

- **Language Compatibility**: Both engines support ECMAScript 5.1, which is the JavaScript standard for that period. However, Nashorn offers improved support for ECMAScript 6 and beyond, including features like arrow functions, template literals, and let/const declarations.

- **Integration with Java**: While Rhino allows us to bridge Java and JavaScript, Nashorn provides better integration capabilities. Nashorn allows seamless interoperability between Java and JavaScript, enabling developers to easily call Java code from JavaScript and vice versa.

- **Maintenance and Future Support**: Rhino has reached its end-of-life status and is no longer actively maintained. On the other hand, Nashorn is actively maintained and receives updates along with JDK (Java Development Kit) releases.

## Comparison with V8
V8 is a JavaScript engine developed by Google, which is known for its use in the Chrome browser and Node.js. Here are some points of comparison between Nashorn and V8:

- **Performance**: V8 is a highly optimized engine known for its blazing-fast execution speed. It outperforms Nashorn in terms of raw performance. However, Nashorn's performance is still quite good and might suffice for most use cases where a JavaScript engine is required within a Java application.

- **Language Compatibility**: Both engines have good support for JavaScript standards. Nashorn focuses more on ECMAScript compatibility, while V8 offers additional features and optimizations tailored for web development.

- **Integration with Java**: Nashorn has a more seamless integration with Java compared to V8. V8 requires the use of additional tools or libraries, such as JNI (Java Native Interface), to bridge the gap between Java and JavaScript code.

- **Popularity and Ecosystem**: V8 has a much larger user base and a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries. This is due to its widespread use in web development, especially with Node.js. Nashorn, while being a capable engine, doesn't have the same level of popularity and community support as V8.

## Conclusion
Java Nashorn is a powerful JavaScript engine that provides excellent integration with Java and delivers good performance for most use cases. While it may not match the raw performance of engines like V8, its ease of use and seamless Java integration make it a popular choice for Java developers. When choosing a JavaScript engine for your Java applications, consider the specific requirements and performance needs to make an informed decision.
