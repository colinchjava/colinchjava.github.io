Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that is included in Java 8 and later versions. It allows you to execute JavaScript code within a Java application and interact seamlessly with Java APIs. One powerful feature of Nashorn is the ability to create custom JavaScript APIs and libraries, providing developers with the flexibility to extend and enhance their applications.

## Why create custom JavaScript APIs and libraries in Nashorn?

There are several benefits to creating custom JavaScript APIs and libraries in Nashorn:

1. Seamless integration: Nashorn allows you to seamlessly integrate JavaScript code with existing Java codebases. This means that you can leverage the power of JavaScript to extend your Java applications without having to rewrite everything from scratch.

2. Reusability: By creating custom JavaScript APIs and libraries, you can encapsulate functionality and make it reusable across multiple applications. This can help improve productivity and reduce development time.

3. Flexibility: Nashorn provides a flexible way to combine Java and JavaScript code. You can easily call Java methods from JavaScript and vice versa, allowing you to build complex applications that leverage the strengths of both languages.

## Getting started with custom JavaScript APIs and libraries in Nashorn

To create a custom JavaScript API or library in Nashorn, you can follow these steps:

1. Define your API: Decide on the functionality that you want to expose to JavaScript. This can include functions, classes, and objects that you want JavaScript code to be able to use.

2. Implement the API: Write the actual Java code that implements the functionality of your API. This can include creating Java classes, methods, and variables.

3. Bind the API to JavaScript: Use the Nashorn scripting engine to bind your Java code to JavaScript. This will make your API accessible to JavaScript code.

4. Test and deploy: Test your API with JavaScript code to ensure that it works as expected. Once you are satisfied, package your API as a JAR file and deploy it with your Java application.

## Example: Creating a custom JavaScript API in Nashorn

Here's an example of creating a custom JavaScript API in Nashorn. Let's say we want to create an API for basic math operations:

```javascript
// MathAPI.js
var MathAPI = {
    add: function(a, b) {
        return Java.type('com.example.MathUtils').add(a, b);
    },
    subtract: function(a, b) {
        return Java.type('com.example.MathUtils').subtract(a, b);
    }
};
```

In the above code, we define a JavaScript object `MathAPI` that exposes `add` and `subtract` functions. These functions call Java methods from the `com.example.MathUtils` class to perform the actual math operations.

To bind this API to JavaScript in Nashorn, we can use the following Java code:

```java
// Main.java
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ScriptEngineManager engineManager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = engineManager.getEngineByName("nashorn");

        // Bind the MathAPI object to the JavaScript engine
        engine.eval("load('path/to/MathAPI.js')");
        engine.put("MathAPI", engine.eval("MathAPI"));
        
        // Use the MathAPI from JavaScript code
        engine.eval("print(MathAPI.add(2, 3))"); // Output: 5
        engine.eval("print(MathAPI.subtract(5, 2))"); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

In the above Java code, we create a Nashorn script engine, bind the `MathAPI` object to the engine, and then execute JavaScript code that calls the `add` and `subtract` functions from the API.

## Conclusion

Creating custom JavaScript APIs and libraries in Nashorn can be a powerful way to extend and enhance your Java applications. By leveraging the flexibility and interoperability between Java and JavaScript, you can create reusable code that integrates seamlessly with your existing Java codebase. With Nashorn, the possibilities are endless for building complex and innovative applications that combine the strengths of both languages.
