Web applications are a crucial part of our daily lives. We use them for shopping, banking, communication, and much more. Traditionally, web applications have been built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, there are alternative approaches that allow developers to leverage their skills in other programming languages. In this blog post, we will explore how to build web applications using Nashorn and JavaFX.

## What is Nashorn?

Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that was introduced in Java 8. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This provides seamless integration between Java and JavaScript, giving developers the flexibility to use their preferred programming language for different parts of the application.

## What is JavaFX?

JavaFX is a set of libraries and tools that allow developers to build rich desktop and mobile applications. It provides a powerful set of UI controls, layout managers, and multimedia support. With JavaFX, developers can create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.

## Combining Nashorn and JavaFX for web applications

By combining Nashorn and JavaFX, we can build web applications that leverage the best of both worlds. JavaFX provides a robust framework for building the user interface, while Nashorn allows us to write the business logic in JavaScript. This combination offers flexibility, performance, and ease of development.

Let's see how we can create a simple web application using Nashorn and JavaFX.

### Step 1: Setting up the project

To get started, we need to set up a Java project with JavaFX and Nashorn dependencies. We can do this by creating a new Maven or Gradle project and adding the necessary dependencies to the build file. Once the project is set up, we can move on to the next step.

### Step 2: Creating the UI

In this example, we will create a simple web application that displays a login form. We will use JavaFX's UI controls to create the form elements and layout. Here's an example of how the UI code may look like:

```java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class LoginApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        TextField usernameField = new TextField();
        TextField passwordField = new TextField();
        Button loginButton = new Button("Login");

        VBox root = new VBox(usernameField, passwordField, loginButton);
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 200);

        primaryStage.setScene(scene);
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Writing the JavaScript logic

Now that we have the UI in place, we can write the JavaScript logic to handle user input and perform actions. Nashorn allows us to define JavaScript functions and bind them to UI events. Here's an example of how we can handle the login button click event:

```java
loginButton.setOnAction(e -> {
    String username = usernameField.getText();
    String password = passwordField.getText();

    // Perform login logic using JavaScript

    // Show success or error message using JavaFX UI
});
```

### Step 4: Running the web application

To run the web application, we can simply execute the Java main method. This will launch the JavaFX application and open the login form in a window. From there, we can interact with the UI and trigger the JavaScript logic.

## Conclusion

Using Nashorn and JavaFX, we can build web applications that combine the power of Java and JavaScript. This allows developers to leverage their existing skills and build robust and responsive applications. Whether you are a Java developer looking to build web applications or a JavaScript developer looking to integrate with Java, Nashorn and JavaFX provide a powerful combination.
