Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that comes bundled with Java 8 and later versions. It provides a way to execute JavaScript code within Java applications. One of the key features of Nashorn is the ability to pass data back and forth between Java and JavaScript seamlessly. In this blog post, we'll explore different ways to pass data between Java and JavaScript in Nashorn.

## Using Bindings
One way to pass data between Java and JavaScript in Nashorn is by using the `Bindings` class. `Bindings` acts as a bridge between the two languages, allowing you to share variables and objects.

To pass data from Java to JavaScript, you can create a `Bindings` object, put your data into it, and then set this object as the `engine`'s context:

```java
ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("nashorn");

Bindings bindings = engine.getBindings(ScriptContext.ENGINE_SCOPE);
bindings.put("myVar", "Hello from Java");

engine.eval("print(myVar)");
```

In the above example, we create a `Bindings` object, put the string value `"Hello from Java"` into it, and then set it as the `engine`'s context. We can then access the `myVar` variable in the JavaScript code and print its value.

## Invoking Java Methods from JavaScript
Nashorn allows you to invoke Java methods directly from JavaScript code. You can pass data to these methods from your JavaScript code and receive the result back.

To invoke a Java method from JavaScript, you first need to expose the Java class and its methods to the JavaScript code using the `engine.put()` method. Then, you can call the Java method from JavaScript using the assigned variable:

```java
public class MyJavaClass {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("nashorn");

engine.put("myJavaClass", MyJavaClass.class);

int result = (int) engine.eval("myJavaClass.add(5, 7)");
System.out.println(result); // Output: 12
```

In the above example, we define a simple Java class with a static `add()` method that adds two integers. We then expose this class to the JavaScript code using `engine.put()` and call the `add()` method from JavaScript. Lastly, we print the result obtained from the Java method call.

## Passing Data to JavaScript
Similarly, you can pass data from Java to JavaScript by exposing Java objects or variables to the JavaScript code. Nashorn provides several methods to do this, including `engine.put()` and `engine.eval()`.

Here's an example that demonstrates passing a Java object to JavaScript:

```java
public class MyJavaClass {
    public String getData() {
        return "Hello from Java";
    }
}

ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("nashorn");

MyJavaClass myJavaObject = new MyJavaClass();
engine.put("myObject", myJavaObject);

engine.eval("print(myObject.getData())");
```

In this example, we create an instance of `MyJavaClass` and expose it to the JavaScript code using `engine.put()`. We can then access the methods and properties of the Java object in JavaScript and print its data.

## Conclusion
Passing data between Java and JavaScript in Nashorn is made easy through the use of `Bindings`, invoking Java methods from JavaScript, and exposing Java objects and variables to the JavaScript code. This functionality allows you to seamlessly integrate both languages in your Java applications and leverage the power and flexibility of JavaScript within a Java environment. #java #javascript
