In this article, we will explore how to build chat applications using Nashorn, a JavaScript engine, and WebSocket, a communication protocol. Chat applications are a common use case for WebSocket as they require real-time communication between users. Nashorn, on the other hand, is a JavaScript engine that allows us to run JavaScript on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). By combining these technologies, we can create robust and scalable chat applications.

## Introduction to Nashorn and WebSocket
Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) starting from JDK 8. It enables us to execute JavaScript code on the JVM, providing seamless integration between Java and JavaScript. WebSocket, on the other hand, is a communication protocol that allows for bidirectional, real-time communication between clients and servers.

## Setting Up the Development Environment
To get started, make sure you have JDK 8 or later installed on your system. Nashorn comes pre-installed with JDK 8, so there is no need for any additional setup. Next, create a new Maven project and add the necessary dependencies for WebSocket support.

```java
import javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpoint;

@ServerEndpoint("/chat")
public class ChatEndpoint {
    // WebSocket endpoint implementation
}
```

## Creating a Simple WebSocket Server
In this section, we will create a simple WebSocket server using Nashorn and the `javax.websocket` package. First, create a new Java class named `ChatEndpoint` and annotate it with `@ServerEndpoint("/chat")`. This annotation tells the server that this class will handle WebSocket connections for the '/chat' URL.

Implement the necessary methods for handling WebSocket events such as `onOpen`, `onMessage`, `onClose`, and `onError`. The `onOpen` method is called when a new WebSocket connection is established, `onMessage` is invoked when a new message is received, `onClose` is triggered when a connection is closed, and `onError` is called when an error occurs.

## Implementing the Chat Functionality
Now that we have set up the WebSocket server, we can proceed to implement the chat functionality. This involves handling messages received from clients and broadcasting them to all connected clients. We can use a simple data structure like a list to keep track of connected clients and send messages to each of them.

```javascript
function onMessage(message) {
    // Broadcast the message to all connected clients
    for each (let client in clients) {
        client.getBasicRemote().sendText(message);
    }
}
```

## Deploying and Scaling the Application
Once the chat application is developed, we can deploy it on a web server or a cloud platform. When deploying to a production environment, it is essential to consider scalability and high availability. We can scale the application horizontally by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer. WebSocket connections are stateful, so we need to ensure that sticky sessions are enabled to maintain the connection between a client and the same server.

## Conclusion
In this article, we explored how to build chat applications using Nashorn and WebSocket. Nashorn allows us to run JavaScript on the JVM, while WebSocket enables real-time communication between clients and servers. By combining these technologies, we can create chat applications that provide seamless and scalable user experiences. Stay tuned for more articles on web development with Java!
