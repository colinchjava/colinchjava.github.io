Nashorn is a JavaScript engine that is built into Java since version 8. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code within their Java applications. While Nashorn provides powerful capabilities, it's important to understand and address the security considerations that come with using it.

In this blog post, we will explore some key security considerations and best practices to keep in mind when using Nashorn.

## 1. Sandbox Environment

One of the first steps to enhance security when using Nashorn is to run the engine in a sandbox environment. A sandbox restricts the privileges and permissions of the Nashorn engine, preventing it from accessing sensitive resources or executing malicious code. This can be achieved by using the `AccessController` class in Java to define a security policy for the Nashorn engine.

## 2. Input Validation

An essential security measure when using Nashorn is to validate any input that is passed to the engine. This helps prevent injection attacks, where malicious code can be injected into the JavaScript and executed within the Nashorn engine. Always sanitize and validate user input before passing it to Nashorn, and consider using libraries or frameworks that provide built-in input validation mechanisms.

## 3. Whitelisting or Blacklisting

To further fortify the security of your application, consider implementing whitelisting or blacklisting of JavaScript functions and APIs that can be accessed by the Nashorn engine. Whitelisting allows only specified functions and APIs to be executed, while blacklisting prohibits the execution of certain functions or APIs. Choose the approach that best fits your application's requirements and carefully evaluate the functions and APIs that Nashorn will have access to.

## 4. Limit Resource Usage

It's important to impose limits on the resources that the Nashorn engine can utilize. This includes setting restrictions on the memory usage, CPU usage, and execution time of JavaScript code executed within Nashorn. By limiting resource usage, you can mitigate the risk of resource exhaustion attacks that can be launched through malicious or poorly written JavaScript code.

## 5. Keep Nashorn Up-to-Date

Oracle, the creator of Nashorn, periodically releases updates that contain security fixes and improvements. It's crucial to keep Nashorn up-to-date by regularly applying these updates to your environment. Staying current ensures that you have the latest security patches and can address any security vulnerabilities that might be present in earlier versions.

Implementing the above security considerations will greatly enhance the overall security posture of your application when using Nashorn. By creating a sandbox environment, validating input, implementing whitelisting or blacklisting, limiting resource usage, and keeping Nashorn up-to-date, you can leverage the power of Nashorn while mitigating potential security risks.

Remember to always stay vigilant and follow best practices to ensure the security of your Java applications using Nashorn!
