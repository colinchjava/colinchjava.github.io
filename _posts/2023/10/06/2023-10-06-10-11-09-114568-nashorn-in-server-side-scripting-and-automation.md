## What is Nashorn?
[Nashorn](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/) is a JavaScript engine for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server-side. It was introduced in JDK 8 as a replacement for the Rhino JavaScript engine.

Nashorn provides seamless interoperability between Java and JavaScript, making it easy to integrate JavaScript code with existing Java applications. It supports the latest ECMAScript 5.1 standard and includes several performance enhancements over Rhino.

## Using Nashorn for Server-Side Scripting
With Nashorn, developers can write server-side scripts in JavaScript instead of using traditional languages like Java or PHP. This enables rapid prototyping and facilitates the development of simple server applications.

To use Nashorn for server-side scripting, you can create a Java class that embeds the Nashorn engine and executes JavaScript code. Here's an example:

```java
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class NashornExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("nashorn");

        try {
            engine.eval("print('Hello from Nashorn!');");
        } catch (ScriptException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `ScriptEngine` for Nashorn, and then use the `eval()` method to execute a simple JavaScript code that prints "Hello from Nashorn!".

## Automating tasks with Nashorn
Nashorn's scripting capabilities can also be utilized for automating various tasks, such as batch processing, data manipulation, or even building command-line tools.

For example, let's say you want to automate the process of resizing images in a directory. You can write a JavaScript script using Nashorn that leverages a Java library like **ImageMagick** to resize the images. Here's an example:

```javascript
var directory = "/path/to/images/";
var files = new java.io.File(directory).listFiles();

for (var i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
    if (files[i].isFile()) {
        // Resize the image using ImageMagick
        // ...
    }
}
```

With Nashorn, you have the power of JavaScript and the flexibility of Java libraries at your fingertips, making it easy to automate various tasks on the server-side.

## Conclusion
Nashorn is a powerful tool for server-side scripting and automation tasks. With its seamless integration with Java and support for the latest ECMAScript standard, developers can leverage the strengths of both languages to build efficient and flexible server applications.

Whether you're building a web application, automating tasks, or prototyping server-side logic, Nashorn provides a reliable and efficient solution. Give it a try and see how it can enhance your server-side scripting and automation workflows.
