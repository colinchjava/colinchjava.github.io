## Introduction
DNS (Domain Name System) is responsible for mapping domain names to IP addresses. DNS caching can help improve the performance of network communication by storing the resolved IP addresses for a certain period of time. In this blog post, we will implement a DNS cache using the `HashMap` data structure in Java.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of the Java programming language and familiarity with the concept of DNS.

## DNS Cache Implementation
### Step 1: Create a DNSCache class
First, let's create a class named `DNSCache` that will be responsible for storing and retrieving DNS entries. We will use a `HashMap` to hold the DNS entries.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class DNSCache {

    private HashMap<String, String> dnsEntries;

    public DNSCache() {
        dnsEntries = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void addDNS(String domainName, String ipAddress) {
        dnsEntries.put(domainName, ipAddress);
    }

    public String getIpAddress(String domainName) {
        return dnsEntries.get(domainName);
    }

    public void clearCache() {
        dnsEntries.clear();
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Adding DNS entries to the cache
To add DNS entries to the cache, we can use the `addDNS` method. This method takes the domain name as a key and the corresponding IP address as the value and adds them to the `dnsEntries` HashMap.

```java
DNSCache cache = new DNSCache();
cache.addDNS("example.com", "192.168.0.1");
cache.addDNS("google.com", "8.8.8.8");
```

### Step 3: Retrieving IP address from the cache
To retrieve the IP address for a given domain name from the cache, we can use the `getIpAddress` method. This method takes the domain name as a parameter and returns the corresponding IP address from the `dnsEntries` HashMap.

```java
String ipAddress = cache.getIpAddress("example.com");
System.out.println(ipAddress); // Output: 192.168.0.1
```

### Step 4: Clearing the cache
If we want to clear the entire DNS cache, we can use the `clearCache` method. This method removes all the entries from the `dnsEntries` HashMap.

```java
cache.clearCache();
```

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we have implemented a simple DNS cache using the `HashMap` data structure in Java. The cache allows us to store DNS entries and retrieve the corresponding IP addresses efficiently. Using a DNS cache can help improve the performance of network communication by reducing the time required for DNS resolution.
