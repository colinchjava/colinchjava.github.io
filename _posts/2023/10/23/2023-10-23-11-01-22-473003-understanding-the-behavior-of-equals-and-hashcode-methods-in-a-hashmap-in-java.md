In Java, the `HashMap` is a widely used data structure that stores key-value pairs. When using a `HashMap`, it is important to understand the behavior of the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods. These methods are defined in the `Object` class, and they have a crucial role in determining how keys are stored and retrieved in the `HashMap`.

## The `equals()` method

The `equals()` method is used to compare two objects for equality. It is defined in the `Object` class, but it is often overridden in custom classes to provide a customized comparison logic. By default, the `equals()` method compares the memory addresses of two objects.

When using a `HashMap`, the `equals()` method is used to compare keys. When retrieving a value from a `HashMap` using a key, the `equals()` method is called to check if the provided key is equal to the stored keys. If a match is found, the corresponding value is returned.

## The `hashCode()` method

The `hashCode()` method is used to generate a hash code value for an object. This method is also defined in the `Object` class. The hash code is an integer value that represents the state of an object and is typically used in hash-based data structures like `HashMap` to determine the bucket location where the object will be stored.

In a `HashMap`, the `hashCode()` method is used to determine the initial bucket location for a key-value pair. The generated hash code is then used to calculate the exact index where the pair will be stored. When retrieving a value, the `hashCode()` method is also called to determine the bucket location and find the matching key.

## Relationship between `equals()` and `hashCode()`

In order for a `HashMap` to function correctly, there are certain rules that must be followed regarding the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods:

1. If two objects are equal according to `equals()`, their hash codes must also be equal. However, the opposite is not required - i.e., two objects with the same hash code may or may not be equal.

2. If the `equals()` method is overridden in a class, the `hashCode()` method should also be overridden to provide a consistent and meaningful hash code implementation. This ensures that objects that are equal according to `equals()` will have the same hash code and be stored in the same bucket.

Failure to follow these rules can lead to unexpected behavior when using a `HashMap`. Keys that do not follow the guidelines can be stored in separate buckets, resulting in redundant entries and potentially incorrect retrieval of values.

## Example usage

Here's an example demonstrating the proper usage of `equals()` and `hashCode()` in a `HashMap`:

```java
class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    
    // Constructor and other methods
    
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Student student = (Student) o;
        return id == student.id &&
                Objects.equals(name, student.name);
    }
    
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(id, name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<Student, Integer> studentGrades = new HashMap<>();
        Student john = new Student(1, "John");
        Student jane = new Student(2, "Jane");
        
        studentGrades.put(john, 95);
        studentGrades.put(jane, 90);
        
        System.out.println(studentGrades.get(john)); // Output: 95
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Student` class that overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on the `id` and `name` fields. This ensures that two `Student` objects with the same `id` and `name` are considered equal, and their hash codes will also be the same. Therefore, when retrieving the value associated with a specific student, the `HashMap` correctly finds and returns the grade.

#Conclusion

Understanding the behavior of the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods in a `HashMap` is essential for proper usage of the data structure. By following the guidelines and providing proper implementations, you can ensure that keys are stored and retrieved correctly, avoiding unexpected behavior and maintaining the integrity of your `HashMap`.
