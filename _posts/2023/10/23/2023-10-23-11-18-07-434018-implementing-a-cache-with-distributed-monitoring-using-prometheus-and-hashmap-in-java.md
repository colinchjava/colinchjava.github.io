In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a cache with distributed monitoring using Prometheus and HashMap in Java. Caching is a technique used to improve the performance of applications by storing frequently accessed data in memory. By implementing a cache, we can reduce the response time of our application and minimize the load on backend resources.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- Gradle or Maven build tools installed (we will be using Gradle in this example)
- Prometheus server installed and running

## Setting up Prometheus
To monitor our cache, we need to set up Prometheus to collect and visualize metrics. Follow these steps to set up Prometheus:
1. Download Prometheus from the official website and extract the contents to a directory on your machine.
2. Configure the Prometheus `prometheus.yml` file with targets, scrape intervals, and other configurations.
3. Start the Prometheus server using the command line.

## Implementing the cache
Let's start implementing the cache using a HashMap data structure in Java. We will create a class called `Cache` that will provide methods to put, get, and remove items from the cache. Here's the code for the `Cache` class:

```java
public class Cache {
    private Map<String, Object> cacheMap;

    public Cache() {
        cacheMap = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void put(String key, Object value) {
        cacheMap.put(key, value);
    }

    public Object get(String key) {
        return cacheMap.get(key);
    }

    public void remove(String key) {
        cacheMap.remove(key);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are using a `HashMap` to store the cached items. You can modify the implementation to use other data structures based on your requirements.

## Monitoring cache metrics
To monitor the cache metrics, we need to expose them in a format that Prometheus can scrape. We can use the Prometheus Java client library to define and register custom metrics. Here's an example of how to monitor the cache size:

```java
import io.prometheus.client.Counter;

public class CacheMetrics {
    private Counter cacheSize;

    public CacheMetrics() {
        cacheSize = Counter.build()
            .name("cache_size")
            .help("Size of the cache")
            .register();
    }

    public void updateCacheSize(int size) {
        cacheSize.set(size);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are using the `Counter` metric type from the Prometheus Java client library to track the size of the cache. We can then call the `updateCacheSize` method to update the metric when adding or removing items from the cache.

To expose the metrics for scraping by Prometheus, we need to configure the Prometheus server to scrape the `/metrics` endpoint of our application.

## Conclusion
By implementing a cache with distributed monitoring using Prometheus and HashMap in Java, we can improve the performance of our applications and gain insights into cache metrics. Prometheus allows us to collect these metrics and visualize them for analysis and troubleshooting.
