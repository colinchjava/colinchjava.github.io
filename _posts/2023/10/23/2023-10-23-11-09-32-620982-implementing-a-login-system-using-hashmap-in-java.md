In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement a login system using the HashMap data structure in Java. The HashMap will be used to store the usernames and passwords of registered users.

## Introduction
A login system is an essential part of many applications, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain features or resources. HashMap is a convenient data structure in Java for storing key-value pairs, where the key is unique.

## Creating a HashMap
To begin, let's create a HashMap to store the usernames and passwords. The keys will be the usernames, and the values will be the corresponding passwords. We can define the HashMap as follows:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

HashMap<String, String> users = new HashMap<>();
```

## Registering Users
To register a user, we need to add their username and password to the HashMap. We can prompt the user to enter their username and password and then store the values in the HashMap using the `put()` method. Here's an example:

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.print("Enter username: ");
String username = scanner.nextLine();

System.out.print("Enter password: ");
String password = scanner.nextLine();

users.put(username, password);
```

## Logging In
To log in, the user needs to enter their username and password. We can retrieve the values from the HashMap using the `get()` method and then compare the entered password with the stored password. Here's an example:

```java
System.out.print("Enter username: ");
String username = scanner.nextLine();

System.out.print("Enter password: ");
String password = scanner.nextLine();

if (users.containsKey(username) && users.get(username).equals(password)) {
    System.out.println("Login successful!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Invalid username or password.");
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement a login system using the HashMap data structure in Java. By storing usernames and passwords as key-value pairs, we can easily register new users and validate their login credentials. This is just one approach to implementing a login system, and there are alternative methods using databases or other data structures.
