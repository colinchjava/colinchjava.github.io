Caching is a commonly used technique to improve the performance of applications by storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage that is quicker to access than the original data source. In a distributed system, it is important to have visibility into the flow of requests and responses across multiple services. Distributed tracing allows us to trace and inspect the full path of a request as it travels through various components of a system.

In this article, we will explore how to implement a cache with distributed tracing using Jaeger and HashMap in Java.

## What is Jaeger?

Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system that helps developers monitor and troubleshoot complex, microservices-based architectures. It provides the ability to trace requests as they flow across multiple services, giving insights into latency, errors, and performance bottlenecks.

## Setting up Jaeger

To set up Jaeger, you need to install the Jaeger agent and the Jaeger collector. These components collect and store traces for analysis. You can refer to the [official Jaeger documentation](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/) for detailed instructions on setting up Jaeger in your environment.

Once Jaeger is set up and running, you can instrument your Java-based application to send traces to Jaeger using the Jaeger client libraries.

## Implementing Cache with HashMap

First, let's implement a simple cache using the `HashMap` data structure in Java.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Cache {
    private Map<String, Object> cache;

    public Cache() {
        cache = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void put(String key, Object value) {
        cache.put(key, value);
    }

    public Object get(String key) {
        return cache.get(key);
    }

    public boolean containsKey(String key) {
        return cache.containsKey(key);
    }

    public boolean remove(String key) {
        return cache.remove(key) != null;
    }
}
```

In the above code, we define a `Cache` class that internally uses a `HashMap` to store key-value pairs. The `put` method adds a key-value pair to the cache, `get` retrieves the value associated with a key, `containsKey` checks if a key is present in the cache, and `remove` removes a key-value pair from the cache.

## Distributed Tracing with Jaeger

To enable distributed tracing using Jaeger, we need to instrument our cache implementation to send traces to Jaeger. This can be achieved by adding tracing code using the Jaeger client library. 

```java
import io.jaegertracing.internal.JaegerTracer;
import io.jaegertracing.internal.samplers.ConstSampler;
import io.jaegertracing.internal.samplers.ProbabilisticSampler;
import io.jaegertracing.propagation.Format;
import io.jaegertracing.propagation.TextMapCodec;
import io.opentracing.Span;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;
import io.opentracing.util.GlobalTracer;

public class TracedCache extends Cache {
    private Tracer tracer;

    public TracedCache() {
        // Initialize JaegerTracer with desired configuration
        JaegerTracer.Builder tracerBuilder = new JaegerTracer.Builder("cache-service")
                .withSampler(new ProbabilisticSampler(0.1))
                .withCodec(Format.Builtin.TEXT_MAP, new TextMapCodec.Builder().build());

        tracer = tracerBuilder.build();
        GlobalTracer.register(tracer);
    }

    @Override
    public void put(String key, Object value) {
        Span span = tracer.buildSpan("Cache Put").start();
        super.put(key, value);
        span.finish();
    }

    @Override
    public Object get(String key) {
        Span span = tracer.buildSpan("Cache Get").start();
        Object value = super.get(key);
        span.finish();
        return value;
    }
}
```

In the above code, we define a `TracedCache` class that extends the `Cache` class. We initialize a `JaegerTracer` and register it as the global tracer using the `GlobalTracer.register()` method. This allows us to use the tracer throughout our application.

We override the `put` and `get` methods of the `Cache` class to add tracing code. We create a new span using the `tracer.buildSpan()` method for each cache operation. The span represents a logical unit of work and helps visualize the flow of requests and responses in the distributed system. We finish the span once the cache operation is complete.

## Conclusion

Implementing a cache with distributed tracing using Jaeger and HashMap in Java allows us to monitor and analyze the flow of requests and responses in a distributed system. Jaeger provides valuable insights into the performance and behavior of our cache, helping us identify bottlenecks and improve the overall system performance.

With the code examples and explanation provided in this article, you have a starting point to implement caching with distributed tracing in your Java applications. The integration of Jaeger for distributed tracing enhances observability and helps you better understand the behavior of your system.
