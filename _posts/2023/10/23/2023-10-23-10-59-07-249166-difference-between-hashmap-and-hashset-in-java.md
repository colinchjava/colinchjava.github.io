When working with Java, you may come across two similar data structures - `HashMap` and `HashSet`. While they may seem similar, there are some key differences between them. Let's dive into the details of each and explore their differences.

## HashMap

`HashMap` is a key-value pair data structure that allows us to store and retrieve elements based on their keys. It uses hashing to store the keys and provides constant time complexity for insertion, retrieval, and deletion operations. Here are some important points about `HashMap`:

- It does not allow duplicate keys, meaning each key must be unique.
- It allows null values and null keys (although only one null key is allowed).
- It provides methods such as `put(key, value)`, `get(key)`, and `remove(key)` to manipulate the elements.
- The order of elements in a `HashMap` is not guaranteed, as it depends on the hash code and bucket index.

## HashSet

`HashSet` is a collection that allows us to store and retrieve elements in no particular order but ensures uniqueness of elements. It is implemented using a `HashMap` internally, where the elements are stored as keys, and the corresponding values are `PRESENT`, a static dummy object. Here are some important points about `HashSet`:

- It does not allow duplicate elements, meaning each element must be unique.
- It does not maintain any order of the elements.
- It allows null values but does not allow duplicate null elements.
- It provides methods such as `add(element)`, `contains(element)`, and `remove(element)`.

## Differences

Now, let's discuss the differences between `HashMap` and `HashSet`:

1. Purpose:
   - `HashMap` is used to store key-value pairs, where each key must be unique.
   - `HashSet` is used to store unique elements, without any key-value mapping.

2. Underlying Implementation:
   - `HashMap` internally uses a hash table to store key-value pairs, where the keys are unique.
   - `HashSet` internally uses a `HashMap` to store the elements, where the elements are stored as keys, and the corresponding values are `PRESENT`.

3. Order:
   - `HashMap` does not guarantee the order of elements. They are stored and accessed based on the hash code and bucket index.
   - `HashSet` does not maintain any order of elements. They are just stored as unique entries without any specific ordering.

4. Null Values/Keys:
   - `HashMap` allows null values and a single null key. 
   - `HashSet` allows null values but does not allow duplicate null elements.

In conclusion, `HashMap` is used for key-value mapping, while `HashSet` is used for storing unique elements. Understanding the differences between these two data structures is essential for choosing the appropriate one based on your requirements.
