Caches are widely used in software applications to improve performance by reducing the load on the underlying data storage systems. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a cache with distributed storage using Hazelcast and HashMap in Java.

## Introduction to Caching

Caching involves storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area called a cache. This allows subsequent requests for the same data to be served quickly, without the need to fetch it from the underlying data store again. Caches are especially useful in scenarios where the underlying data access is slow, such as network requests or database queries.

## Using Hazelcast

Hazelcast is an open-source in-memory data grid platform that provides distributed data structures and caching capabilities. It allows you to distribute and scale your cache across multiple nodes, improving performance and ensuring high availability.

To use Hazelcast in your Java application, you need to add the Hazelcast dependency to your project's build file. For example, if you are using Maven, you can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>4.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Once you have added the dependency, you can create a Hazelcast instance in your application code:

```java
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;

public class Cache {
    private HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;

    public Cache() {
        hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
    }
}
```

## Implementing the Cache

In this example, we will implement a simple cache using a HashMap as the underlying storage for each cache entry. Hazelcast will be used for distributed caching, allowing multiple cache instances to communicate with each other.

```java
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import java.util.Map;

public class Cache {
    private HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;
    private Map<String, Object> storage;

    public Cache() {
        hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        storage = hazelcastInstance.getMap("cache");
    }

    public void put(String key, Object value) {
        storage.put(key, value);
    }

    public Object get(String key) {
        return storage.get(key);
    }

    public void delete(String key) {
        storage.remove(key);
    }
}
```

The `Cache` class uses the `HazelcastInstance` to create a distributed `Map` named "cache". The `put`, `get`, and `delete` methods provide basic cache operations that interact with the underlying Hazelcast storage.

## Putting it all Together

To use the cache, you can create an instance of the `Cache` class and perform cache operations as needed:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cache cache = new Cache();
        cache.put("key1", "value1");
        Object value = cache.get("key1");
        System.out.println(value); // Output: value1
        cache.delete("key1");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement a cache with distributed storage using Hazelcast and HashMap in Java. By leveraging distributed caching, you can improve the performance and scalability of your applications by reducing the load on the underlying data storage systems. Hazelcast provides an easy-to-use API and powerful features for distributed caching, making it a great choice for implementing caching solutions in Java applications.
