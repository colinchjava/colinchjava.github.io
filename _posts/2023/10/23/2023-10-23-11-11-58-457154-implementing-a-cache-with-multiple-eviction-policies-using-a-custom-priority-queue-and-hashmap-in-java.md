Caching is a popular technique used in software development to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory. When designing a cache, choosing an eviction policy is crucial as it determines how the cache handles data when it reaches its capacity. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a cache with multiple eviction policies using a custom priority queue and HashMap in Java.

## Eviction Policies

Eviction policies determine which elements to remove from the cache when it reaches its maximum capacity. Some commonly used eviction policies are:

- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: This policy removes the least recently used elements from the cache. It assumes that if an element hasn't been accessed recently, it is less likely to be accessed in the future.
- **Least Frequently Used (LFU)**: This policy removes the least frequently used elements from the cache. It tracks the frequency of each element's access and removes the ones with the lowest frequency.
- **First In First Out (FIFO)**: This policy removes the elements from the cache in the order they were added, similar to a queue.

## Implementing the Cache

To implement a cache with multiple eviction policies, we can use a combination of a custom priority queue and a HashMap in Java.

First, let's create a class called `CacheEntry` to represent each entry in the cache. It will store the key, value, and the eviction policy-specific attributes.

```java
class CacheEntry<K, V> {
    private K key;
    private V value;
    // Additional attributes for eviction policy (e.g., access time, frequency)

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
```

Next, let's create the `Cache` class that will handle the caching logic. It will have a HashMap to store the key-value pairs and a priority queue to track the eviction order based on the chosen eviction policy.

```java
class Cache<K, V> {
    private Map<K, CacheEntry<K, V>> cacheMap;
    private PriorityQueue<CacheEntry<K, V>> evictionQueue;
    private int maxSize;

    public Cache(int maxSize) {
        this.maxSize = maxSize;
        this.cacheMap = new HashMap<>();
        this.evictionQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();
    }

    public void put(K key, V value) {
        // Add or update the cache entry in the cache map
        // Add or update the cache entry in the eviction queue based on the eviction policy
        // If the cache size exceeds the max size, evict the least desirable entry
    }

    public V get(K key) {
        // Retrieve the cache entry from the cache map
        // Update the eviction queue based on the eviction policy
        // Return the value associated with the key
    }

    // Other methods for eviction policies, cache statistics, etc.
}
```

## Testing the Cache

Let's test our cache implementation with different eviction policies. Here's an example using the LRU eviction policy:

```java
Cache<Integer, String> cache = new Cache<>(3);
cache.put(1, "Value 1");
cache.put(2, "Value 2");
cache.put(3, "Value 3");

System.out.println(cache.get(1));  // Output: Value 1

cache.put(4, "Value 4");

System.out.println(cache.get(2));  // Output: null, as it has been evicted due to LRU policy
System.out.println(cache.get(4));  // Output: Value 4
```

## Conclusion

Implementing a cache with multiple eviction policies provides flexibility in adapting to different use cases. By combining a custom priority queue and HashMap, we can create a cache that efficiently manages its capacity and evicts entries based on various eviction policies. This approach allows us to optimize data access and improve the overall performance of our applications.

By implementing a cache with multiple eviction policies, we can effectively manage and optimize data access, which results in improved application performance.
