In Java, a `HashMap` is a widely used data structure that stores key-value pairs. Sometimes, we may need to clear the contents of a `HashMap` to completely remove all the elements from it. In this article, we will discuss different ways to clear a `HashMap` in Java.

### Using the clear() method

The simplest and most straightforward way to clear a `HashMap` is by using its `clear()` method. The `clear()` method removes all the key-value pairs and leaves the `HashMap` empty.

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> numbers = new HashMap<>();
numbers.put("One", 1);
numbers.put("Two", 2);
numbers.put("Three", 3);

System.out.println("HashMap before clearing: " + numbers);

numbers.clear();

System.out.println("HashMap after clearing: " + numbers);
```

Output:
```
HashMap before clearing: {One=1, Two=2, Three=3}
HashMap after clearing: {}
```

### Creating a new instance

Another way to clear a `HashMap` is by creating a new instance of it. This approach involves reassigning the `HashMap` variable to a new object, which effectively discards the previous contents.

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> numbers = new HashMap<>();
numbers.put("One", 1);
numbers.put("Two", 2);
numbers.put("Three", 3);

System.out.println("HashMap before clearing: " + numbers);

numbers = new HashMap<>();

System.out.println("HashMap after clearing: " + numbers);
```

Output:
```
HashMap before clearing: {One=1, Two=2, Three=3}
HashMap after clearing: {}
```

### Removing key-value pairs individually

If you don't want to clear the entire `HashMap` but rather remove specific key-value pairs, you can do so using the `remove()` method. This method takes the key as an argument and removes the corresponding key-value pair from the `HashMap`.

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> numbers = new HashMap<>();
numbers.put("One", 1);
numbers.put("Two", 2);
numbers.put("Three", 3);

System.out.println("HashMap before removing key: " + numbers);

numbers.remove("Two");

System.out.println("HashMap after removing key: " + numbers);
```

Output:
```
HashMap before removing key: {One=1, Two=2, Three=3}
HashMap after removing key: {One=1, Three=3}
```

### Conclusion

In Java, there are multiple ways to clear a `HashMap`. The `clear()` method removes all the key-value pairs, creating an empty `HashMap`. Alternatively, you can create a new instance of the `HashMap` or remove individual key-value pairs using the `remove()` method.

By clearing a `HashMap`, you can efficiently discard its contents and reuse it for new data without the need for creating a new object.
