## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
Caching is a common technique used in software applications to improve performance and reduce latency by storing frequently accessed data in memory. In distributed systems, load balancing ensures that requests are evenly distributed among multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a cache with distributed load balancing using Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and a HashMap in Java.

## Setting up the Project<a name="setting-up-the-project"></a>
To get started, we need to create a new Java project and add the necessary dependencies. Open your favorite IDE and create a new Maven or Gradle project. Add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file:

```
<!-- Spring Cloud LoadBalancer -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
  <version>2.2.5.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure to synchronize the dependencies to download them.

## Implementing the Cache<a name="implementing-the-cache"></a>
Next, let's implement the cache using a HashMap. We will use the cache for storing key-value pairs, where the key represents the data to be cached, and the value represents the actual cached data.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Cache {
  private Map<String, Object> cache;

  public Cache() {
    this.cache = new HashMap<>();
  }

  public void put(String key, Object value) {
    cache.put(key, value);
  }

  public Object get(String key) {
    return cache.get(key);
  }

  public boolean containsKey(String key) {
    return cache.containsKey(key);
  }

  public void remove(String key) {
    cache.remove(key);
  }
}
```

In the above code, we have defined a `Cache` class with methods for `put`, `get`, `containsKey`, and `remove` operations on the cache. The cache is implemented using a HashMap, where the key is a string and the value is an object.

## Implementing Distributed Load Balancing<a name="implementing-distributed-load-balancing"></a>
To achieve distributed load balancing, we will utilize Spring Cloud LoadBalancer. Spring Cloud LoadBalancer provides a higher-level abstraction over client-side load balancing, allowing us to seamlessly switch between different load balancer implementations such as Ribbon, Eureka, or custom. Let's implement the load balancing logic within our cache implementation.

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.client.ServiceInstance;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.LoadBalancerClient;

public class CacheWithLoadBalancing {
  private LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient;
  private Cache cache;

  public CacheWithLoadBalancing(LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient) {
    this.loadBalancerClient = loadBalancerClient;
    this.cache = new Cache();
  }

  public void put(String key, Object value) {
    cache.put(key, value);
  }

  public Object get(String key) {
    if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
      return cache.get(key);
    } else {
      String serviceName = "service-name"; // Replace with your actual service name
      ServiceInstance instance = loadBalancerClient.choose(serviceName);
      // Make a request to the instance and retrieve the data
      // Store the retrieved data in the cache
      // Return the retrieved data
    }
  }

  public void remove(String key) {
    cache.remove(key);
  }
}
```

In the above code, we have created a `CacheWithLoadBalancing` class that uses a `LoadBalancerClient` from Spring Cloud LoadBalancer to choose a service instance to retrieve data from when the requested data is not present in the cache. You will need to replace `'service-name'` with the actual service name you want to load balance.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>
In this blog post, we have explored how to implement a cache with distributed load balancing using Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and a HashMap in Java. By utilizing Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, we can easily distribute requests among multiple service instances, improving the performance and scalability of our application. Adding caching further enhances the performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory. This combination of caching and load balancing can significantly improve the overall performance and user experience of distributed systems.

We encourage you to explore Spring Cloud LoadBalancer documentation for more advanced configurations and options to suit your specific requirements.
