Java provides two commonly used classes for implementing hash-based data structures: `HashMap` and `HashTable`. Though they may seem similar, there are key differences between these two classes that are crucial to understand. In this article, we will explore and compare `HashMap` and `HashTable` in terms of performance, synchronization, and usage.

## Performance

The main difference between `HashMap` and `HashTable` lies in how they handle synchronization.

- **HashMap**: `HashMap` is not synchronized and is considered to be a better choice in scenarios where thread-safety is not a concern. It is generally faster and more efficient when accessed by a single thread.

- **HashTable**: `HashTable` is synchronized, making it thread-safe. This means that multiple threads can access and modify the structure simultaneously without causing data inconsistencies. However, this synchronization comes at a cost - it can impact performance, especially in multi-threaded environments.

## Synchronization

As mentioned earlier, one of the key differences between the two classes is the level of synchronization they provide.

- **HashMap**: Being non-synchronized, `HashMap` is not inherently thread-safe. If multiple threads concurrently access or modify a `HashMap` without external synchronization, it can lead to data corruption and inconsistent results.

- **HashTable**: In contrast, `HashTable` is synchronized, meaning it handles thread-safety internally. Every method in `HashTable` is synchronized, ensuring that only one thread can access the structure at a given time. This makes `HashTable` suitable for use in multi-threaded environments.

## Usage

The usage of `HashMap` and `HashTable` is often determined by the requirements of the application.

- **HashMap**: `HashMap` may be the preferred choice when thread-safety is not a concern. It is widely used in single-threaded applications or scenarios where synchronization is manually implemented.

- **HashTable**: `HashTable` is recommended in situations where multi-threaded access is required. It provides built-in synchronization, ensuring consistent and safe operations across multiple threads.

## Conclusion

In summary, the main difference between `HashMap` and `HashTable` in Java lies in their synchronization capabilities. `HashMap` is not synchronized, providing better performance for single-threaded scenarios, while `HashTable` is synchronized and can be used in multi-threaded environments to ensure thread-safety. Understanding these differences is essential in selecting the appropriate class based on the requirements of your application.
