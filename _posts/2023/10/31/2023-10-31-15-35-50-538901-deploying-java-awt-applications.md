Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) is a widely used framework for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java applications. Once you have developed your Java AWT application, the next step is to deploy it so that users can run it on their machines. In this blog post, we will go through the steps required to deploy Java AWT applications.

## Introduction
When deploying a Java AWT application, you have different options depending on your target audience and requirements. One common approach is to create an executable JAR file, which allows users to run your application by simply double-clicking on it. Another approach is to create an installable package that includes all the necessary files and dependencies for easy installation on various platforms.

## Creating an Executable JAR
To create an executable JAR for your Java AWT application, you can follow these steps:

1. Compile your Java source code and generate the class files.
   ```
   $ javac MyApplication.java
   ```

2. Create a manifest file (`manifest.txt`) that specifies the main class to run.
   ```
   Main-Class: MyApplication
   ```

3. Create the JAR file using the `jar` command, including the manifest file and the class files.
   ```
   $ jar cvfm MyApplication.jar manifest.txt *.class
   ```

4. Test the executable JAR by double-clicking on it or running it from the command line.
   ```
   $ java -jar MyApplication.jar
   ```

Creating an executable JAR simplifies the deployment process for users as they can directly launch your Java AWT application without needing to install any additional software.

## Creating an Installable Package
If you need to distribute your Java AWT application to a wider audience or want to provide a streamlined installation experience, you can create an installable package. Some popular options for creating installable packages include Java Web Start, Inno Setup, and Install4j.

1. Java Web Start: Java Web Start allows users to launch Java applications directly from the web using a web browser. You can package your Java AWT application as a Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file and provide a web page link for users to launch the application.

2. Inno Setup: Inno Setup is a free script-driven installation system for creating installers for Windows applications. You can use Inno Setup to create an installer for your Java AWT application that includes all the necessary files and dependencies.

3. Install4j: Install4j is a cross-platform Java installer builder that supports various platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It provides a graphical interface to create professional installers for your Java AWT application.

Choose the appropriate installable package creation tool based on your target platform and requirements to package your Java AWT application for easy installation.

## Conclusion
Deploying Java AWT applications involves creating an executable JAR or an installable package. The choice depends on your target audience and deployment requirements. Creating an executable JAR allows users to run your application by simply double-clicking on it, while an installable package provides a streamlined installation experience. Choose the deployment method that suits your needs and distribute your Java AWT applications with ease.
