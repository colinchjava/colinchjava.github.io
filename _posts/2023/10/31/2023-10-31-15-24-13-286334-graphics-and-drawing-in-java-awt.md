Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) provides several classes and methods for performing graphics and drawing operations. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Java AWT to create graphics, draw shapes, and perform basic drawing operations.

## Getting Started with Java AWT

To start with Java AWT graphics, you need to create a `Frame` or `Panel` to display the graphics on the screen. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates creating a basic `Frame` and setting its size:

```java
import java.awt.*;

public class GraphicsDemo extends Frame {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      GraphicsDemo graphicsDemo = new GraphicsDemo();
      graphicsDemo.setSize(500, 500);
      graphicsDemo.setVisible(true);
   }
}
```

## Drawing Shapes

Java AWT provides various methods for drawing shapes such as lines, rectangles, ellipses, and arcs. Let's see an example of drawing a red rectangle on the `GraphicsDemo` frame created earlier:

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
   g.setColor(Color.RED);
   g.drawRect(50, 50, 200, 100);
}
```

In this example, the `paint()` method is overridden to perform custom painting. The `setColor()` method sets the color to be used for drawing, and `drawRect()` is used to draw a rectangle with the specified position and size.

Similarly, you can use methods like `drawLine()`, `drawOval()`, and `drawArc()` to draw other shapes.

## Performing Basic Drawing Operations

Java AWT also provides additional methods for performing basic drawing operations such as filling shapes, drawing images, and adding text. Here's an example of drawing a filled circle with an image and text inside it:

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
   g.setColor(Color.GREEN);
   g.fillOval(50, 50, 100, 100);
   
   Image img = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage("image.png");
   g.drawImage(img, 50, 50, this);
   
   g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
   g.drawString("Hello, Java!", 70, 110);
}
```

In this example, the `fillOval()` method is used to draw a filled circle, and the `drawImage()` method is used to draw an image inside the circle. Lastly, the `drawString()` method is used to add text to the circle.

## Conclusion

Java AWT provides a powerful set of tools for performing graphics and drawing operations in Java applications. You can create various shapes, apply colors, draw images, and add text to enhance your graphical user interfaces.
