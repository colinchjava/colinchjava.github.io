Java Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is responsible for transforming Java bytecode into native machine code, making Java programs run faster. One of the key optimizations performed by the JIT compiler is called method inlining, which replaces method invocations with the actual code of the method to reduce overhead.

However, there are cases where the assumptions made by the JIT compiler during method inlining may become invalid at runtime. This can happen due to a variety of reasons, such as changes in the program's execution path or changes in the values of variables and parameters.

When such invalid assumptions are detected, the JIT compiler needs to deoptimize the compiled code and fall back to the interpreter or recompile the code with new optimizations. This process is known as deoptimization and recompilation.

## Deoptimization

Deoptimization is the process of reverting the optimized native machine code back to bytecode interpretation. When deoptimization occurs, the JIT compiler identifies the deoptimization point where the assumptions are violated and replaces the compiled code with a special trap. This trap transfers the execution to the interpreter, which can handle the deoptimized execution.

During deoptimization, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) also captures the state of the program, including the values of variables and parameters, so that it can recompile the code with new optimizations if necessary.

## Recompilation

Recompilation is the process of generating new optimized code for the deoptimized section. When the JVM captures the deoptimized state, it uses this information to recompile the code taking into account the new runtime conditions.

Recompilation can be expensive in terms of time and resources, so the JIT compiler tries to minimize the number of times it needs to recompile code. It does this by checking if the conditions that caused the deoptimization still persist. If the conditions have stabilized, the JIT compiler can make more accurate assumptions and generate optimized code that avoids the need for further deoptimization.

## Conclusion

Deoptimization and recompilation are important mechanisms in the Java JIT compiler to ensure efficient execution of Java programs. They allow the compiler to adapt to runtime changes and generate optimized code that takes advantage of the current program conditions.

Understanding how deoptimization and recompilation work can help developers write more efficient and performant Java code. It also emphasizes the importance of profiling and optimizing critical sections of code as frequent deoptimizations can impact the overall performance of the application.
