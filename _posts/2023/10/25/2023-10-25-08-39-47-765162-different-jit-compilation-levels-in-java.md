Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation is a technique used by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to improve the performance of Java programs. The JIT compiler dynamically translates bytecode into machine code, which allows the JVM to execute the code faster. Java provides different levels of JIT compilation to balance between startup time and runtime performance. Let's explore the different levels available in Java.

## 1. Client Compiler

The client compiler is the default level of JIT compilation in Java. It focuses on reducing the startup time of the application. The client compiler quickly analyzes and compiles the most frequently executed methods to improve the initial performance. It favors faster optimization techniques and performs minimal optimization compared to other levels.

To enable the client compiler, use the `-client` flag when starting the JVM:

```java
java -client YourMainClass
```

## 2. Server Compiler

The server compiler, also known as the C2 compiler, is designed to optimize long-running Java applications. It performs a deeper analysis of the code and applies more aggressive optimizations to improve the overall runtime performance. The server compiler spends more time on analyzing patterns and executing complex optimization techniques, which might increase the startup time.

To enable the server compiler, use the `-server` flag when starting the JVM:

```java
java -server YourMainClass
```

## 3. Tiered Compilation

Java also offers a tiered compilation mode that combines both the client and server JIT compilers to get the benefits of both approaches. The tiered compilation starts with the client compiler and then gradually promotes frequently executed methods to the server compiler, allowing them to benefit from more advanced optimizations. This approach aims to provide a good balance between startup time and runtime performance.

To enable tiered compilation, use the `-server` and `-XX:+TieredCompilation` flags when starting the JVM:

```java
java -server -XX:+TieredCompilation YourMainClass
```

## Conclusion

Java's JIT compilation levels provide different trade-offs between startup time and runtime performance. The client compiler focuses on faster startup, while the server compiler focuses on optimizing long-running applications. The tiered compilation combines both approaches to strike a balance. Experimenting with different levels can help in achieving optimal performance for your Java applications.
