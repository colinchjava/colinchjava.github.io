Rolling back deployments is an essential capability in Kubernetes that allows you to revert to a previous version of your Java application. This can be incredibly useful in scenarios where you discover issues or unexpected behavior after a deployment.

In this blog post, we will walk you through the process of rolling back Java app deployments in Kubernetes.

## Step 1: Check Deployment History

Before rolling back a deployment, it's important to check the deployment history to identify the revision you want to roll back to. This can be done using the `kubectl` command-line tool with the following command:

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name>
```

This command will show you the revision history of the specified deployment.

## Step 2: Rollback to Previous Revision

Once you have identified the revision you want to roll back to, you can use the `kubectl` command-line tool to initiate the rollback. The command syntax is as follows:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> --to-revision=<revision-number>
```

Replace `<deployment-name>` with the name of your deployment and `<revision-number>` with the revision number you obtained from step 1.

## Step 3: Verify Rollback

After initiating the rollback, it's crucial to verify that the rollback was successful. You can use the `kubectl` command-line tool to check the status of the deployment:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>
```

This command will display the status of the deployment and whether it is successfully rolled back or not.

## Conclusion

Rolling back Java app deployments in Kubernetes is a straightforward process that ensures you can quickly revert to a previous version of your application when needed. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can confidently handle deployment issues and maintain the stability of your Java applications.
