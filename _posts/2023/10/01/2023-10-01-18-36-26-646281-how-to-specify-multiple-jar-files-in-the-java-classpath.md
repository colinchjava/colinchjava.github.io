When working with Java, it is common to use external JAR files to add additional functionality to your applications. Specifying multiple JAR files in the Java CLASSPATH allows you to include the necessary dependencies for your Java application to run successfully.

To specify multiple JAR files in the Java CLASSPATH, you can use one of the following methods:

## Method 1: Using wildcard character

You can use the wildcard character (`*`) to include all the JAR files in a directory. By doing so, you don't have to specify each JAR file individually.

To include all JAR files from a directory called `lib`, you can use the following command:

```java
java -cp "lib/*" YourMainClass
```

In this example, `lib/*` refers to all the JAR files present in the `lib` directory. Replace `YourMainClass` with the name of your main class.

## Method 2: Specifying individual JAR files

If you want to specify individual JAR files instead of using the wildcard character, you can list the JAR files separated by the operating system-specific path separator (`:` on Linux/Mac or `;` on Windows).

For instance, to include `jackson-core.jar`, `jackson-databind.jar`, and `jackson-annotations.jar`, you can use the following command:

```java
java -cp "jackson-core.jar:jackson-databind.jar:jackson-annotations.jar" YourMainClass
```

Replace `YourMainClass` with the name of your main class.

## Conclusion

Specifying multiple JAR files in the Java CLASSPATH is essential when your application requires external dependencies. Whether you choose to use the wildcard character or specify each JAR file individually, having the proper CLASSPATH ensures that your Java application can access the required libraries.
