In order to run a Java application, such as a ticket reservation system, you need to ensure that the necessary Java PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables are set correctly on your computer. This ensures that the Java runtime can locate the required libraries and execute your application.

## Setting the Java PATH

The Java PATH refers to the location where the Java binaries are installed on your system. To set the Java PATH, follow these steps:

1. Determine the installation path of your Java Development Kit (JDK). This is typically located in the "Program Files" directory on Windows or "/usr/lib/jvm" on Linux.
2. Open the environment variables settings on your computer. On Windows, you can search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu. On Linux, open a terminal and type `nano ~/.bashrc` to edit the bash configuration file.
3. Add the following line to set the Java PATH:

   ```shell
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/java/bin
   ```

   Replace "/path/to/java" with the actual installation path of your JDK.

4. Save the changes and exit the editor.
5. Open a new terminal window to ensure the changes take effect.

## Setting the Java CLASSPATH

The Java CLASSPATH is used to specify the location of the Java classes that are required for your application to run. To set the Java CLASSPATH, follow these steps:

1. Determine the location of the JAR files or directories that contain the required Java classes for your ticket reservation system.
2. Open the environment variables settings on your computer, following the same steps as above.
3. Add the following line to set the Java CLASSPATH:

   ```shell
   export CLASSPATH=/path/to/class/files:/path/to/library.jar
   ```

   Replace "/path/to/class/files" with the directory containing your class files and "/path/to/library.jar" with the path to any external library JAR files your application depends on. You can specify multiple paths by separating them with colons (":" on Linux).

4. Save the changes and exit the editor.
5. Open a new terminal window to ensure the changes take effect.

Remember to replace "/path/to/java" and "/path/to/class/files" in the above examples with the actual paths relevant to your system and application.

By correctly setting the Java PATH and CLASSPATH, you ensure that your ticket reservation system can run without any issues. Happy coding!
