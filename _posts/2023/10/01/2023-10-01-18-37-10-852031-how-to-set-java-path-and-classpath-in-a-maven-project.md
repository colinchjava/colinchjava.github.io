## Setting the Java PATH

The Java PATH is an environment variable that tells the operating system where to find the Java executable. Here's how you can set the Java PATH in a Maven project:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Determine the installation directory of your Java JDK. This is typically located in the "Program Files" directory on Windows.
3. Set the Java PATH by running the following command on Windows:

   ```shell
   set PATH="<path_to_jdk>\bin";%PATH%
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_jdk>` with the actual path to your Java JDK installation directory.

   On macOS or Linux, run the following command:

   ```shell
   export PATH="<path_to_jdk>/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   Again, replace `<path_to_jdk>` with the actual path to your Java JDK installation directory.

4. To verify if the Java PATH is set correctly, open a new terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```shell
   java -version
   ```

   This should display the Java version installed on your system.

## Setting the Java CLASSPATH

The Java CLASSPATH is an environment variable that specifies the directories or JAR files where Java looks for classes and resources. Here's how you can set the Java CLASSPATH in a Maven project:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Determine the location of your project's dependencies.
3. Set the Java CLASSPATH by running the following command on Windows:

   ```shell
   set CLASSPATH="<path_to_dependencies>\*"
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_dependencies>` with the actual path to the directory containing your project's dependencies.

   On macOS or Linux, run the following command:

   ```shell
   export CLASSPATH="<path_to_dependencies>/*"
   ```

   Again, replace `<path_to_dependencies>` with the actual path to the directory containing your project's dependencies.

4. Save and close the terminal or command prompt.

By setting the Java PATH and CLASSPATH in your Maven project, you ensure that Java can locate and use the necessary executable and dependencies.

Don't forget to save and close the terminal or command prompt after setting the Java PATH and CLASSPATH. If you encounter any issues, make sure to verify that the paths you provided are correct and that the installations are properly configured.
