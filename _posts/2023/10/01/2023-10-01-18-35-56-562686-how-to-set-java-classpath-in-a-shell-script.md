In Linux or Unix-like systems, you can set the CLASSPATH in a shell script using the following steps:

1. Open a text editor and create a new shell script file, for example, `setclasspath.sh`.

2. In the script file, add the following line to set the CLASSPATH:

```shell
export CLASSPATH=/path/to/your/library.jar:/path/to/your/compiled/classes
```

Replace `/path/to/your/library.jar` and `/path/to/your/compiled/classes` with the actual paths to your library JAR file and compiled class files, respectively. If you have multiple paths, you can separate them using a colon (`:`).

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Make the script file executable by running the following command:

```shell
chmod +x setclasspath.sh
```

5. Now, you can run the script by typing `./setclasspath.sh` in the terminal. This will set the CLASSPATH environment variable for the current session.

To verify if the CLASSPATH is set correctly, you can use the following command:

```shell
echo $CLASSPATH
```

It will display the value of the CLASSPATH variable.

Remember, setting the CLASSPATH in a shell script only applies to the current session. If you want to set it permanently, you need to update the startup file of your shell (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`) with the `export` command mentioned above.

Setting the CLASSPATH correctly is crucial to ensure that your Java applications can find the necessary dependencies at runtime, so make sure to double-check the paths and ensure they point to the correct files or directories.
