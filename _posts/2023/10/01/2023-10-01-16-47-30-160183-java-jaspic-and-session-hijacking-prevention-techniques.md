Session hijacking is a serious security concern for web applications. It occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's session and performs malicious actions on their behalf. One of the effective techniques to prevent session hijacking is by using Java JASPIC (Java Authentication SPI for Containers). JASPIC provides an API for plugging in custom authentication modules into Java EE containers, allowing developers to implement various security mechanisms, including session hijacking prevention.

## How does Java JASPIC prevent Session Hijacking?

Java JASPIC allows developers to intercept the authentication process and apply additional security measures. Here's how it can be used to prevent session hijacking:

1. **Token-based Authentication**: One approach to prevent session hijacking is by using token-based authentication. Instead of relying on session cookies, the application generates a unique token for each user session. This token is then stored in a secure location, such as a database or encrypted within a cookie. With JASPIC, developers can implement a custom authentication module that validates the token and ensures its integrity, making it harder for attackers to hijack the session.

2. **IP Address and User-Agent Verification**: Another technique to prevent session hijacking is by verifying the IP address and user-agent of the client. JASPIC allows developers to inspect the request headers and compare them with the information stored in the user session. If any mismatch is detected, the session can be invalidated, preventing potential session hijacking attempts.

## Example Code: Implementing Session Hijacking Prevention with JASPIC

Here's an example of how Java JASPIC can be used to implement session hijacking prevention:

```java
@ServerEndpoint(value = "/websocket", configurator = CustomServerEndpointConfigurator.class)
public class WebSocketEndpoint {

    @OnOpen
    public void onOpen(Session session, EndpointConfig config) {
        HttpServletRequest request = (HttpServletRequest)config.getUserProperties()
                            .get(HttpServletRequest.class.getName());
        
        // Perform token-based authentication or IP address/User-Agent verification
        // ...
    }

    // Other WebSocket endpoint methods

}
```

In the above code snippet, we have a WebSocket endpoint that utilizes JASPIC for session hijacking prevention. The `@ServerEndpoint` annotation configures the endpoint, and the `EndpointConfig` object contains the request information, including the `HttpServletRequest` object.

Within the `onOpen` method, developers can implement their custom session hijacking prevention logic by performing token-based authentication or verifying the IP address and user-agent. This ensures that the user's session is protected and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
