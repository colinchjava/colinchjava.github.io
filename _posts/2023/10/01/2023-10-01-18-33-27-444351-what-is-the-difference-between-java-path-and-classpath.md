Java is a popular programming language that is widely used for building various types of applications. When working with Java, you may often come across the terms "PATH" and "CLASSPATH". While they both are related to the Java environment, they serve different purposes. In this article, we will explain the difference between Java PATH and CLASSPATH.

## Java PATH
The Java PATH is an environment variable that tells the operating system where to find the executable files for Java tools and commands. It is used by the operating system to search for the Java binaries when you run Java commands from the command line or terminal.

Setting the Java PATH allows you to conveniently use Java commands, such as `java`, `javac`, and `jar`, from anywhere in the command line. When you type a Java command, the operating system looks in each directory listed in the PATH variable to find the corresponding executable file.

To set the Java PATH, you need to add the path to the Java bin directory to the PATH variable. This can be done either by modifying the system environment variables or by using the command line tools provided by your operating system.

It is important to note that the Java PATH is unrelated to the actual Java code execution or compilation. It is purely a system-level configuration that enables you to run Java commands from the command line.

## Java CLASSPATH
The Java CLASSPATH, on the other hand, is an environment variable that specifies the locations where Java should look for additional class files during program execution. It tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where to find the required Java classes that are not in the default Java runtime environment.

When you compile and run Java code that uses external libraries or classes, you need to make sure that the JVM can locate those classes at runtime. This is where the CLASSPATH comes into play. By setting the CLASSPATH, you let the JVM know where it should search for the required class files.

The CLASSPATH can be set in multiple ways, such as using command-line options, environment variables, or through build tools like Maven or Gradle. You can provide multiple directories or JAR files separated by colons or semicolons, depending on your operating system.

It's worth mentioning that if the CLASSPATH is not set, Java will use the default CLASSPATH, which includes the Java runtime environment's standard library.

## Conclusion
In summary, the Java PATH is used by the operating system to locate the Java executable files, allowing you to run Java commands from anywhere in the command line. On the other hand, the Java CLASSPATH is used by the JVM to find additional class files during program execution, enabling you to use external libraries or classes.

Understanding the difference between the Java PATH and CLASSPATH is crucial when working with Java, as it allows you to configure the environment and build Java applications effectively.
