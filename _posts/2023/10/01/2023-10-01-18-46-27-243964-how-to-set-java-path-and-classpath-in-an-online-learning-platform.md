When working with Java on an online learning platform, it is essential to set up the PATH and CLASSPATH in order to properly compile and run Java programs. This guide will walk you through the steps to configure these environment variables.

## Setting the Java PATH

The PATH environment variable is used by the operating system to locate executable files. To set the Java PATH, follow these steps:

1. **Find the Java installation directory:** Locate the directory where Java is installed on your computer.

2. **Copy the Java installation path:** Once you've found the installation directory, copy the complete path.

3. **Open System Properties:** On your online learning platform, navigate to the System Properties. The process may vary depending on the platform you are using.

4. **Set Environment Variables:** Look for the section that allows you to set environment variables. This may be under the "Advanced" tab or a similar name.

5. **Add the Java PATH:** In the environment variables section, locate the "Path" variable and click on "Edit" or "New". 

6. **Add the Java installation path:** Paste the copied Java installation path into the field and click "OK" to save the changes.

## Configuring the Java CLASSPATH

The CLASSPATH environment variable specifies the location where Java should look for classes and libraries. To configure the Java CLASSPATH, follow these steps:

1. **Identify your Java project structure:** Determine where your Java project files and any external libraries are located.

2. **Create a CLASSPATH environment variable:** In the same environment variables section mentioned above, locate the "New" button to create a new environment variable.

3. **Set the CLASSPATH variable:** Enter the paths where your project files and libraries are located, separated by semicolons (;). For example:

```java
CLASSPATH = C:\path\to\project\files;C:\path\to\external\libraries
```

Ensure that you include all the necessary paths for your specific project.

4. **Save the changes:** Click "OK" to save the CLASSPATH environment variable.

By properly configuring the PATH and CLASSPATH variables, you will be able to successfully compile and run Java code on your online learning platform.
