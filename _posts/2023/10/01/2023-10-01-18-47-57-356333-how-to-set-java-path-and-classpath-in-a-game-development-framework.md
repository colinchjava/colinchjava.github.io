When working with a game development framework in Java, it's important to properly set the `PATH` and `CLASSPATH` environment variables. These variables ensure that the Java compiler and runtime environment can locate the necessary libraries and dependencies.

## Setting the Java PATH

The `PATH` environment variable tells the operating system where to find executable files. To set the Java `PATH`, follow these steps:

1. Locate the installation directory of your Java Development Kit (JDK).
2. Open the command prompt or terminal, depending on your operating system.
3. Enter the following command to set the `PATH` variable:

   ```shell
   export PATH="/path/to/jdk/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/jdk` with the actual path to your JDK installation directory.

4. Verify the `PATH` variable by running the following command:

   ```shell
   java -version
   ```

   This should display the version of Java installed on your system.

## Setting the Java CLASSPATH

The `CLASSPATH` environment variable tells the Java compiler and runtime environment where to find the class files and libraries required by your game development framework. To set the `CLASSPATH`, follow these steps:

1. Determine the location of the library files or jar files required by your game development framework.
2. Open the command prompt or terminal, depending on your operating system.
3. Enter the following command to set the `CLASSPATH` variable:

   ```shell
   export CLASSPATH="/path/to/library.jar:/path/to/framework.jar:$CLASSPATH"
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/library.jar` and `/path/to/framework.jar` with the actual paths to the required library and framework files.

4. Verify the `CLASSPATH` variable by running the following command:

   ```shell
   java -classpath $CLASSPATH com.example.Game
   ```

   Replace `com.example.Game` with the main class of your game. This command should successfully execute your game without any classpath-related errors.
