When compiling and running Java programs, you might often need to specify the CLASSPATH to include the directories or JAR files containing your dependencies. However, there are some techniques you can use to compile and run your Java programs without explicitly specifying the CLASSPATH every time.

## 1. Using the `-classpath` or `-cp` option

Java provides the `-classpath` (or `-cp`) option that allows you to specify the CLASSPATH during compilation and execution. By using this option, you can avoid the need to set the CLASSPATH environment variable.

### Compilation:
```java
javac -classpath /path/to/dependency.jar MyProgram.java
```

### Execution:
```java
java -classpath /path/to/dependency.jar MyProgram
```

You can specify multiple directories or JAR files in the classpath using the **colon** ( : ) delimiter on Unix-based systems or the **semicolon** ( ; ) delimiter on Windows.

## 2. Using the `java -jar` command

If your application is packaged as a self-contained JAR file that includes all its dependencies, you can use the `java -jar` command to run the JAR file. This command automatically handles the classpath for you.

```java
java -jar myprogram.jar
```

Ensure that the manifest file in your JAR specifies the main class. Otherwise, you'll need to use the `-cp` option to specify the dependencies.
  
## 3. Utilizing a build tool

Using a build tool like Maven or Gradle can simplify the handling of classpath dependencies. These tools manage the dependencies for you and make sure they are included during compilation and execution.

For example, using Maven, declare your dependencies in the project's `pom.xml` file and let Maven take care of downloading the required JAR files and setting up the classpath automatically.

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.example</groupId>
        <artifactId>dependency</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Build tools also provide other benefits like dependency resolution, build automation, and easier project management.

## Conclusion

With these techniques, you can compile and run your Java programs without explicitly specifying the CLASSPATH each time. Whether you use the `-classpath` option, the `java -jar` command, or a build tool, these methods will simplify the management of dependencies in your Java projects.
