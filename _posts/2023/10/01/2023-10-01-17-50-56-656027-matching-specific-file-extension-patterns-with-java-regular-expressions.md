Let's suppose we want to match files with the extensions `.txt`, `.csv`, and `.log`. We'll use the `java.util.regex` package to accomplish this task.

First, we need to define the regular expression pattern for matching file extensions. The pattern can be constructed using the pipe (`|`) character, which acts as an OR operator, allowing us to match multiple patterns in a single expression.

```java
String fileExtensionPattern = "\\.txt|\\.csv|\\.log";
```

In the above code snippet, we've escaped the dot character (`.`) using a backslash (`\`) since the dot has a special meaning in regular expressions.

To match a file against this pattern, we can use the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package.

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;

public class FileExtensionMatcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] fileNames = {"file1.txt", "file2.csv", "file3.log", "file4.jpg"};

        String fileExtensionPattern = "\\.txt|\\.csv|\\.log";
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(fileExtensionPattern);

        for (String fileName : fileNames) {
            Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(fileName);
            if (matcher.find()) {
                System.out.println(fileName + " is a valid file");
            } else {
                System.out.println(fileName + " is not a valid file");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we define an array of file names `fileNames` that we want to match against the file extension pattern. We compile the pattern using `Pattern.compile()` and then iterate over each file name.

For each file name, we create a `Matcher` using the pattern and use the `find()` method to check if the pattern matches any part of the file name. If it does, we output that it's a valid file; otherwise, we output that it's not a valid file.

When you run the above code, you will get the following output:

```
file1.txt is a valid file
file2.csv is a valid file
file3.log is a valid file
file4.jpg is not a valid file
```

By using regular expressions, we can easily match specific file extensions in a given text or file name. This can be highly useful when filtering files based on their extensions or performing any other file-related operations.

Remember to import the `java.util.regex.Pattern` and `java.util.regex.Matcher` classes before using regular expressions.
