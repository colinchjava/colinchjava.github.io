In order to properly run a Human Resources Management System (HRMS) written in Java, it is important to set the `PATH` and `CLASSPATH` environment variables correctly. 

## What is the PATH variable?

The `PATH` variable is used by the operating system to locate executable files. By adding the Java executable directory to the `PATH`, we make it easier to run Java programs from the command line.

To set the Java `PATH`:

1. Open the **System Properties** window by right-clicking on **This PC** or **My Computer** and selecting **Properties**.

2. Click on **Advanced system settings**.

3. In the **System Properties** window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.

4. In the **Environment Variables** dialog, under the **System variables** section, locate the **Path** variable and click on **Edit**.

5. In the **Edit Environment Variable** dialog, append the path to your Java installation to the **Variable value** field. For example, if your Java installation is located at `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_241\bin`, add `;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_241\bin` to the end of the current `Path` value.

6. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialogs.

## What is the CLASSPATH variable?

The `CLASSPATH` variable is used by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to locate Java class files, libraries, and resources required by a Java program.

To set the Java `CLASSPATH`:

1. Open the **System Properties** window as described in the previous section.

2. In the **Environment Variables** dialog, under the **System variables** section, click on **New**.

3. In the **New System Variable** dialog, enter `CLASSPATH` as the **Variable name**.

4. Enter the path(s) to your HRMS application's JAR file(s) or directory in the **Variable value** field. Separate multiple paths with a semicolon (`;`).

5. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialogs.

## Verifying the Java PATH and CLASSPATH

To verify that the Java `PATH` and `CLASSPATH` are set correctly, follow these steps:

1. Open a new Command Prompt window.

2. Type `java -version` and press **Enter**. You should see the version of Java installed on your system.

3. If you have your HRMS application compiled into a JAR file, navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located in the Command Prompt.

4. Type `java -jar your_hrms_application.jar` and press **Enter**. Replace `your_hrms_application.jar` with the actual name of your HRMS JAR file. If the application runs without any errors, it means the `CLASSPATH` is set correctly.

With the `PATH` and `CLASSPATH` variables properly set, you can now run your HRMS application seamlessly from the command line or integrate it into other Java projects.
