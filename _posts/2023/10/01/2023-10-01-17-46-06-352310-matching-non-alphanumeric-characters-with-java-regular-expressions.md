To begin, we need to define what we mean by "non-alphanumeric" characters. In Java, alphanumeric characters refer to any alphabet letter (a-z or A-Z) or digit (0-9). Non-alphanumeric characters are those that are neither alphabet letters nor digits, such as symbols or whitespace.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to match non-alphanumeric characters using regular expressions in Java:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class NonAlphanumericMatcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello! How are you? 123@#";
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\W");  // \W matches any non-alphanumeric character

        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);
        while (matcher.find()) {
            System.out.println("Match found: " + matcher.group());
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, we first define the input text as `Hello! How are you? 123@#`. We then create a pattern using the `Pattern.compile()` method with the regular expression `\\W`. The `\\W` pattern matches any non-alphanumeric character.

We then create a `Matcher` object by calling `pattern.matcher(text)` and use a `while` loop to iterate through all matches found in the text. Finally, we print out each matched non-alphanumeric character using `matcher.group()`.

When we run the above code, it will produce the following output:
```
Match found: !
Match found:  
Match found: ?
Match found: @
Match found: #
```

This output confirms that the regular expression `\\W` successfully matched all non-alphanumeric characters in the input text.

In addition to `\\W`, Java regular expressions provide several other predefined character classes for matching different types of characters. Some commonly used character classes include `\\d` for digits, `\\s` for whitespace, `\\p{Punct}` for punctuation, and so on. You can also create custom character classes by enclosing characters within square brackets, like `[!@#]` to match specific non-alphanumeric characters.

In conclusion, Java regular expressions provide a convenient way to match non-alphanumeric characters within strings. By using predefined character classes or custom character classes, you can easily accomplish this task. So go ahead and explore the power of regular expressions in Java to handle your string manipulation needs.
