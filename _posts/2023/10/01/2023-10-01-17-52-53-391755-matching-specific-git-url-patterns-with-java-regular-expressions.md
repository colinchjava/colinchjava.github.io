Git URLs typically follow a specific pattern, with variations depending on the protocol and repository hosting service. Some common Git URL patterns include:

1. `https` protocol with the `github.com` hosting service:
   `https://github.com/username/repository.git`

2. `https` protocol with a generic Git hosting service:
   `https://git.example.com/username/repository.git`

3. `git` protocol with the `github.com` hosting service:
   `git://github.com/username/repository.git`

To match these patterns using regular expressions in Java, we can use the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package. Let's take a look at how we can do this for each pattern.

Pattern 1: `https` protocol with the `github.com` hosting service

```java
String urlPattern1 = "^https://github.com/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\\.git$";
```

Explanation:
- `^` and `$` represents the start and end of the line.
- `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` matches any alphanumeric character and `_` or `-`.
- `+` matches one or more occurrences of the previous expression.
- `\\.git` matches the literal characters `.git`.

Pattern 2: `https` protocol with a generic Git hosting service

```java
String urlPattern2 = "^https://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\\.git$";
```

Explanation:
- `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]` matches any alphanumeric character, `.` or `-`.
- `^https://` matches the literal characters `https://`.

Pattern 3: `git` protocol with the `github.com` hosting service

```java
String urlPattern3 = "^git://github.com/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\\.git$";
```

Explanation:
- `^git://` matches the literal characters `git://`.

Once we have defined our patterns, we can use the `Matcher.matches()` method to check if a given URL matches the pattern.

```java
String gitUrl = "https://github.com/username/repository.git";

if (gitUrl.matches(urlPattern1)) {
    System.out.println("Pattern 1 matched!");
}
```

By using regular expressions in Java, we can easily match specific Git URL patterns and perform further operations based on the matching results. Remember to customize the patterns according to your specific needs.
