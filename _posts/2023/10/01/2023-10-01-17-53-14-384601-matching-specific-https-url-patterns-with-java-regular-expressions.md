To start, let's define the specific HTTPS URL pattern we want to match. For this example, we will consider URLs that start with "https://" followed by a domain name, a dot, and a top-level domain (TLD). The domain name can consist of alphanumeric characters and can include hyphens, but it cannot start or end with a hyphen. The TLD can only consist of alphabetical characters and must be between 2 and 6 characters long.

Using Java's built-in regular expression support, we can define a regular expression pattern to match the specific URL format:

```java
String urlPattern = "^https:\\/\\/([a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$";
```

In this pattern, we start with "^" to indicate the beginning of the line, followed by "https://" to match the literal characters. Then, we have a group ([a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?\\.)+ to match the domain name and dot combination. This allows for alphanumeric characters and hyphens in the domain name, while ensuring it does not start or end with a hyphen. Finally, we specify [a-zA-Z]{2,6} to match the TLD, which consists of alphabetical characters only and must be between 2 and 6 characters long. We end the pattern with "$" to indicate the end of the line.

Now that we have our pattern, we can use it to check if a given URL matches the desired format:

```java
String url = "https://www.example.com";
if (url.matches(urlPattern)) {
    System.out.println("URL matches the desired pattern");
} else {
    System.out.println("URL does not match the desired pattern");
}
```

In this example, we check if the URL "https://www.example.com" matches the desired pattern by using the `matches` method of the `String` class. If the URL matches the pattern, we print "URL matches the desired pattern"; otherwise, we print "URL does not match the desired pattern".

By using regular expressions in Java, we can easily match specific HTTPS URL patterns. This allows us to validate and parse URLs, ensuring they adhere to a specific format. Regular expressions offer a flexible and powerful approach to pattern matching and can be a valuable tool in various programming scenarios.
