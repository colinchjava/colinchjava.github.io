When working with temperature data in Java, you may encounter situations where you need to match and extract specific temperature patterns from a string. This can be achieved efficiently using regular expressions, a powerful tool for pattern matching and manipulating text.

In this blog post, we will explore how to match specific temperature patterns using Java regular expressions.

## The Temperature Pattern

We will focus on matching temperatures in the Celsius scale, which are typically represented as a number followed by the degree symbol (°C). Here are a few examples of valid temperature patterns:

- 25°C
- -10°C
- 37.5°C
- 0°C

## Matching a Temperature Pattern

To match a temperature pattern, we can use the `java.util.regex` package, which provides the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes for regular expression operations.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to match a temperature pattern and extract the numerical value from it:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class TemperatureMatcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "The temperature today is 25°C";
        String pattern = "(-?\\d+(\\.\\d+)?)(°C)";

        Pattern compiledPattern = Pattern.compile(pattern);
        Matcher matcher = compiledPattern.matcher(text);

        if (matcher.find()) {
            String temperature = matcher.group(1);
            System.out.println("Temperature: " + temperature);
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we define the regular expression pattern `(-?\\d+(\\.\\d+)?)(°C)`, which consists of three groups:

1. `(-?\\d+(\\.\\d+)?)`: Matches the numerical value of the temperature, including optional negative sign and decimal point.
2. `(\\.\\d+)?`: Matches the decimal part of the temperature if present.
3. `(°C)`: Matches the degree symbol (°C) that indicates the temperature scale.

We then compile the pattern using `Pattern.compile(pattern)` and create a `Matcher` object to match against the input text. If the pattern is found, we extract the temperature value using `matcher.group(1)` and print it.

## Conclusion

Regular expressions provide a powerful and efficient way to match and extract specific temperature patterns in Java. By using the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package, we can easily define and apply regular expression patterns to temperature data.

Remember to handle edge cases and validate the extracted temperature values based on your specific requirements.
