Java is a popular programming language used for creating a wide range of applications. However, when working with Java, you might encounter errors related to the PATH and CLASSPATH settings. In this blog post, we will discuss some common errors and how to fix them.

## 1. 'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command

This error occurs when the Java compiler, 'javac', is not found in the system PATH. To fix this, you need to add the path to the JDK bin directory to the system PATH.

To resolve this error, follow these steps:

1. Find the location of the JDK bin directory on your system. It is usually installed in a directory like `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk<version>\bin` on Windows or `/usr/lib/jvm/java-<version>-openjdk/bin` on Linux.
2. Open the System Properties dialog by right-clicking on the Computer icon, selecting *Properties*, and then clicking on *Advanced System Settings*.
3. In the *System Properties* dialog, click on the *Environment Variables* button.
4. In the *Environment Variables* dialog, find the *Path* variable under *System Variables* and click on *Edit*.
5. Add a new entry that points to the JDK bin directory. For example, if the JDK is installed in `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk14.0.1\bin`, add `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk14.0.1\bin` to the *Path* variable.
6. Click *OK* to save the changes and close all the dialogs.

Now you should be able to run the 'javac' command without any errors.

## 2. 'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command

This error occurs when the Java runtime, 'java', is not found in the system PATH. Similar to the previous error, you need to add the path to the JDK bin directory to the system PATH.

To resolve this error, follow the same steps provided in the previous section to update the *Path* variable with the JDK bin directory.

After updating the PATH variable, you should be able to run the 'java' command without any issues.

## Conclusion

Errors related to the Java PATH and CLASSPATH settings are common when working with Java. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you should be able to resolve these errors and successfully execute Java programs.
