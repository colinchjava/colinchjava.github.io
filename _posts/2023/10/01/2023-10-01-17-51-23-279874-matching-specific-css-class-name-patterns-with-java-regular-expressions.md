To match CSS class names with specific patterns using Java regex, you can follow the steps below:

1. Import the necessary Java classes for regular expression matching:
```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
```

2. Create a pattern using the desired regex expression:
```java
String regex = "pattern_here";
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);
```

Replace "pattern_here" with your desired regex pattern. For example, if you want to match all class names that start with "btn" and have a number at the end, the pattern would be something like "^btn\\d+$".

3. Iterate over a collection of CSS class names and check for matches:
```java
List<String> classNames = Arrays.asList("btn", "btn1", "btn-info", "not-matched");

for (String className : classNames) {
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(className);
    if (matcher.matches()) {
        // Do something with the matched class name
        System.out.println("Matched class name: " + className);
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `matches()` method is used to check if the given class name matches the pattern. If it does, you can perform any desired action or manipulation on the matched class name.

4. Run the code and observe the output:
```
Matched class name: btn1
```

The code will identify and print any matched class names based on the defined pattern.

Remember to fine-tune the regex pattern according to your specific requirements. Regular expressions can be complex, so it's important to test and validate your patterns to ensure they match the desired CSS class names accurately.

With Java regular expressions, you can efficiently match and manipulate CSS class names based on specific patterns, giving you greater control and flexibility in web development projects.
