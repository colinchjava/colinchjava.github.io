When running a Cucumber test in Java, it is often necessary to set the *PATH* and *CLASSPATH* environment variables to ensure that the test can access the required Java libraries and dependencies. In this blog post, we will explore how to set these variables for a Cucumber test in Java.

## What are PATH and CLASSPATH?

**PATH** is an environment variable that specifies the directories in which the operating system should look for executable programs. It allows you to run commands and programs from any location in the command prompt or terminal.

**CLASSPATH**, on the other hand, is an environment variable that specifies the directories or JAR files that Java should look into when searching for classes and resources. It is essential for Java applications to find and load the required dependencies.

## Setting Java PATH

To set the Java PATH variable, follow these steps:

1. Open the System Properties dialog by right-clicking on "My Computer" (Windows) or clicking on the Apple menu and selecting "System Preferences" (Mac).
2. Click on "Advanced system settings" (Windows) or "Advanced" (Mac) to open the System Properties window.
3. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. Under the "System variables" section, scroll down and find the "Path" variable.
5. Click on "Edit" (Windows) or "Modify" (Mac) to edit the PATH variable.
6. Append the directory path of your Java installation, such as `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_241\bin` (Windows) or `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_241.jdk/Contents/Home/bin` (Mac) to the existing value. Ensure that each path is separated by a semicolon (`;` for Windows) or a colon (`:` for Mac).
7. Click "OK" to save the changes.

✅ **Hashtags: #Java #PATH**

## Setting Java CLASSPATH

To set the Java CLASSPATH variable, follow these steps:

1. Similar to the previous steps, open the System Properties dialog and go to the "Environment Variables" window.
2. Under the "System variables" section, click on "New" to add a new variable.
3. Enter `CLASSPATH` as the variable name.
4. Set the variable value to the directories or JAR file paths that you want to include in the CLASSPATH. Separate multiple paths by a semicolon (`;` for Windows) or a colon (`:` for Mac).
   - For example, you can set the value as `C:\path\to\lib1.jar;C:\path\to\lib2.jar` (Windows) or `/path/to/lib1.jar:/path/to/lib2.jar` (Mac).
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

✅ **Hashtags: #Java #CLASSPATH**

By following these steps, you can easily set the Java PATH and CLASSPATH variables for your Cucumber tests. This ensures that the test environment has access to the required Java libraries and dependencies, enabling the seamless execution of your Cucumber scenarios.
