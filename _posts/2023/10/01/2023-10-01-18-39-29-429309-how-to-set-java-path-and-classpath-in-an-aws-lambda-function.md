When creating an AWS Lambda function with Java, it is important to set the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables properly to ensure that the Java runtime can locate and execute the necessary dependencies.

## Setting Java PATH

To set the Java PATH in an AWS Lambda function, follow the steps below:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.

2. Select the desired Lambda function, or create a new one.

3. In the **Configuration** tab, scroll down to the **Environment variables** section.

4. Click on the **Edit** button to modify the environment variables.

5. Add a new key-value pair:
   - Key: `PATH`
   - Value: `/var/lang/bin:$PATH`

   This configuration will prepend the Java executable path to the existing PATH variable.

6. Click on the **Save** button to save the changes.

## Setting Java CLASSPATH

To set the Java CLASSPATH in an AWS Lambda function, follow the steps below:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.

2. Select the desired Lambda function, or create a new one.

3. In the **Configuration** tab, scroll down to the **Environment variables** section.

4. Click on the **Edit** button to modify the environment variables.

5. Add a new key-value pair:
   - Key: `CLASSPATH`
   - Value: `/var/task/*`

   This configuration specifies that the Java CLASSPATH should include all the jar files located in the `/var/task` directory.

6. Click on the **Save** button to save the changes.

By properly setting the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables in your AWS Lambda function, you ensure that the Java runtime can find the necessary dependencies and run your Java code without any issues.
