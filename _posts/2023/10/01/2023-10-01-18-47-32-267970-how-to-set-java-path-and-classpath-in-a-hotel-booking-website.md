When developing a hotel booking website using Java, you may need to set the Java PATH and CLASSPATH variables to ensure your application runs smoothly. In this blog post, we will walk you through how to set these variables on your local machine.

## Setting the Java PATH Variable

The PATH variable tells the operating system where to find the Java executable files. Follow these steps to set the Java PATH variable:

1. **Locate the JDK Installation Directory**: Note down the directory path where you have installed the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine. This is usually something like `C:\Program Files\Java\jdkX.X.X_XXX`.

2. **Open System Properties**: Right-click on "My Computer" or "This PC" (depending on your Windows version), and select "Properties". Alternatively, you can search for "System" in the Start menu and open the System Properties.

3. **Open Environment Variables**: In the System Properties window, click on the "Advanced" tab, and then click on the "Environment Variables" button.

4. **Add Java to the PATH Variable**: In the "System Variables" section, locate the "Path" variable and click on the "Edit" button.

5. **Add Java JDK Directory**: In the "Edit Environment Variable" dialog, click on the "New" button, and enter the path of the JDK installation directory you noted earlier. Click "OK" to save the changes.

6. **Verify Java PATH**: Open a new command prompt window and type `java -version`. If you see the Java version information, it means the PATH variable has been set correctly.

## Setting the Java CLASSPATH Variable

The CLASSPATH variable tells Java where to find the application classes and libraries. Follow these steps to set the Java CLASSPATH variable:

1. **Locate the JAR Files**: Identify the JAR files that your hotel booking website depends on. These could include JDBC drivers, libraries, or any other files required for your application.

2. **Open Environment Variables**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 from the previous section.

3. **Add JAR Files to CLASSPATH**: In the "System Variables" section, click on the "New" button to create a new variable.

4. **Enter Variable Name And Value**: Enter `CLASSPATH` in the "Variable Name" field and provide the path to the JAR files or directories that contain the classes and libraries. Separate multiple paths with a semicolon (;).

5. **Save Changes**: Click "OK" to save the changes.

6. **Verify Java CLASSPATH**: Restart any running Java applications or open a new command prompt window and run your application. If there are no errors related to missing classes or libraries, it means the CLASSPATH variable has been set correctly.

Congratulations! You have successfully set the Java PATH and CLASSPATH variables for your hotel booking website. Now you can develop and run your Java application without any issues.
