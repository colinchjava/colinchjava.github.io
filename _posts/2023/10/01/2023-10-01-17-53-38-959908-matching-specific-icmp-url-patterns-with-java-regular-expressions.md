In networking and communication protocols, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is primarily used for diagnostic or troubleshooting purposes. It includes various messages that are sent between devices to indicate error conditions or exchange information. 

In this blog post, we will explore how to use Java regular expressions to match specific ICMP URL patterns. Regular expressions provide powerful tools for pattern matching and can be especially useful when dealing with large datasets or complex patterns.

Let's consider a scenario where we want to extract specific URLs from ICMP messages. We can accomplish this using the Pattern and Matcher classes in Java.

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class IcmpUrlMatcher {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String icmpMessage = "ICMP: Echo (ping) reply URL: http://example.com";
    String pattern = "URL: ((http|https)://\\S+)";
    
    Pattern regex = Pattern.compile(pattern);
    Matcher matcher = regex.matcher(icmpMessage);
    
    if (matcher.find()) {
      String url = matcher.group(1);
      System.out.println("Extracted URL: " + url);
    } else {
      System.out.println("No URL found in ICMP message.");
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, we define a regular expression pattern `URL: ((http|https)://\\S+)` which matches URLs starting with "http://" or "https://". The `(http|https)` part specifies that either "http" or "https" should be present. The `\\S+` matches one or more non-whitespace characters after the protocol.

We then create a Pattern object using `Pattern.compile(pattern)`, and a Matcher object using `regex.matcher(icmpMessage)`. By calling `matcher.find()`, we search for the first occurrence of the pattern in the ICMP message. If a match is found, we extract the URL by calling `matcher.group(1)`.

In the example, the output will be:
```
Extracted URL: http://example.com
```

If no match is found, the output will be:
```
No URL found in ICMP message.
```

Regular expressions provide a flexible and powerful way to match and extract specific patterns from strings. With Java's Pattern and Matcher classes, we can easily handle complex pattern matching scenarios, such as extracting URLs from ICMP messages.
