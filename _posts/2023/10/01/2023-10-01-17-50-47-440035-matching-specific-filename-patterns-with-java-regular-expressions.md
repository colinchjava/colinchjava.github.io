Java provides robust support for working with regular expressions. Regular expressions are powerful patterns that can be used to match and manipulate strings. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Java regular expressions to match specific filename patterns.

### Understanding Regular Expressions

A regular expression, commonly referred to as regex, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It can be used to match and manipulate strings based on specific patterns. In the case of filename patterns, we can utilize regular expressions to match filenames based on different criteria such as extension, prefix, or any specific pattern.

### Using Java `Pattern` and `Matcher` Classes

Java provides the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package to work with regular expressions. The `Pattern` class represents a compiled representation of a regular expression, while the `Matcher` class produces match results by comparing an input string against a pattern.

To match specific filename patterns, we can follow these steps:

1. Compile the regular expression pattern using `Pattern.compile()`.
2. Create a `Matcher` object by invoking the `matcher()` method on the compiled `Pattern` object.
3. Use the `Matcher` object's `matches()` method to check if the input string matches the specified pattern.

### Example - Matching a Specific File Extension

Let's start with a simple example where we want to match filenames with a specific extension, such as `.txt`. Here's how we can achieve this using Java regular expressions:

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

public class FilenameMatcher {

  public static boolean matchExtension(String filename, String extension) {
    String pattern = "\\." + extension + "$";
    Pattern regex = Pattern.compile(pattern);
    Matcher matcher = regex.matcher(filename);
    return matcher.matches();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String filename = "example.txt";
    String extension = "txt";

    boolean isMatch = matchExtension(filename, extension);
    System.out.println("Filename: " + filename + ", Matched: " + isMatch);
  }
}
```

In the code above, we define a `matchExtension` method that takes a `filename` and an `extension` as arguments. The method compiles the regular expression pattern by concatenating a backslash, the extension, and the end-of-line symbol `$`. It then creates a `Matcher` object using the compiled pattern and matches it against the input filename. Finally, it returns `true` if there's a match and `false` otherwise.

When the above code is executed, it will output: `Filename: example.txt, Matched: true`, indicating that the filename matches the specified extension pattern.

### Conclusion

Java regular expressions provide a powerful way to match specific filename patterns. By using the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes, we can easily compile and match against regular expressions. This allows us to implement complex matching logic for filenames based on specific patterns, extensions, prefixes, and more.

By leveraging the flexibility of Java regular expressions, we can build sophisticated file-processing applications that handle specific filename patterns with ease.
