Roman numerals have been used for centuries and are still occasionally used today. If you are working with Roman numerals in Java and need to match specific patterns, regular expressions can be a powerful tool. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Java regular expressions to match specific Roman numeral patterns.

## Basic Roman numeral representation

Before diving into regular expressions, it's important to understand the basic rules of Roman numeral representation. Roman numerals consist of the following symbols:

| Symbol | Value |
|--------|-------|
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

Roman numerals are formed by combining symbols and adding their respective values. However, there are specific rules to follow to ensure valid representation:

1. Symbols can be repeated up to three times in a row. For example, III represents 3, and XXX represents 30.
2. If a smaller symbol appears before a larger symbol, it means subtraction. For example, IV represents 4 (1 less than 5), and IX represents 9 (1 less than 10).
3. If a smaller symbol appears after a larger symbol, it means addition. For example, VIII represents 8 (5 + 1 + 1 + 1).

## Using regular expressions to match Roman numeral patterns

To match specific Roman numeral patterns using regular expressions, we can leverage the power of Java's `Pattern` class. Let's look at a few examples:

### Matching valid Roman numerals

We can start by creating a regular expression that matches valid Roman numerals. The following regular expression pattern can be used:

```java
String pattern = "^(M{0,3})(CM|CD|D?C{0,3})(XC|XL|L?X{0,3})(IX|IV|V?I{0,3})$";
```

In this pattern:

- `(M{0,3})` matches 0 to 3 occurrences of 'M'.
- `(CM|CD|D?C{0,3})` matches 'CM' or 'CD' or an optional 'D' followed by 0 to 3 occurrences of 'C'.
- `(XC|XL|L?X{0,3})` matches 'XC' or 'XL' or an optional 'L' followed by 0 to 3 occurrences of 'X'.
- `(IX|IV|V?I{0,3})` matches 'IX' or 'IV' or an optional 'V' followed by 0 to 3 occurrences of 'I'.

Using this regular expression pattern, we can easily validate whether a given string is a valid Roman numeral.

### Matching specific patterns

Sometimes, we might want to match specific Roman numeral patterns. For example, we might want to match Roman numerals greater than 1000 or those that end with 'V'. Here are a few examples of regular expressions for specific patterns:

- Roman numerals greater than 1000:

  ```java
  String pattern = "^(M{4,})(CM|D?C{0,3})(XC|XL|L?X{0,3})(IX|IV|V?I{0,3})$";
  ```

  In this pattern, `(M{4,})` matches four or more occurrences of 'M'.

- Roman numerals ending with 'V':

  ```java
  String pattern = "^(M{0,3})(CM|CD|D?C{0,3})(XC|XL|L?X{0,3})(I[V])$";
  ```

  In this pattern, `(I[V])` matches 'IV' or 'V'.

## Conclusion

Java regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to match specific Roman numeral patterns. By leveraging the regular expression patterns discussed in this blog post, you can easily validate and manipulate Roman numerals in your Java applications. Make use of these regular expression patterns to handle Roman numeral inputs efficiently.
