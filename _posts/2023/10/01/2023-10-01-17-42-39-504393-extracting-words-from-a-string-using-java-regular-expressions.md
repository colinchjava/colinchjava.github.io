In Java, you can use regular expressions to extract words from a given string. Regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to match patterns in text.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to extract words from a string using Java regular expressions:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class WordExtractor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String inputString = "Hello, how are you doing today?";

        // Define the regular expression pattern to match words
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\b\\w+\\b");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(inputString);

        // Iterate through the matches and extract the words
        while (matcher.find()) {
            String word = matcher.group();
            System.out.println(word);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a regular expression pattern `\\b\\w+\\b` to match words. Here's a breakdown of what each component of the pattern means:
- `\\b`: Matches a word boundary
- `\\w+`: Matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores)
- `\\b`: Matches another word boundary

We then use the `Pattern` class to compile the regular expression pattern, and the `Matcher` class to perform the matching operation on the input string.

Finally, we use a `while` loop to iterate through the matches found by the `Matcher` and extract the words. Each matched word is printed to the console.

By utilizing regular expressions in Java, you can easily extract words from a string and perform various operations on them. Remember to import the `java.util.regex` package to use the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes.
