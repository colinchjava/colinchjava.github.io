In Java, the CLASSPATH is an environment variable that specifies the location of Java class files, libraries, and resources required for running Java programs. The default CLASSPATH is used when no custom CLASSPATH is specified.

## Default CLASSPATH in Java

The default CLASSPATH in Java includes the following locations:

1. Current working directory: Java looks for class files in the current working directory by default.

2. Java Platform classes: Java standard library classes, such as `java.lang`, `java.util`, and `java.io`, are included in the default CLASSPATH.

3. Extension directories: Java looks for classes in the **Java Extension Mechanism** (JEM) directories. These directories contain optional packages that extend the functionality of the Java platform.

4. Java Class Libraries: Java looks for classes in the system-defined class libraries, which contain commonly used libraries and packages.

## Managing the default CLASSPATH

To manage the default CLASSPATH in Java, you can use the following approaches:

1. **Setting the CLASSPATH environment variable**: You can set the CLASSPATH environment variable to include additional directories or JAR files that contain your custom classes or third-party libraries. Make sure to append your custom directories without overriding the default CLASSPATH.

2. **Using the -classpath command-line option**: You can specify the CLASSPATH for a specific program using the `-classpath` or `-cp` command-line option. This overrides the default CLASSPATH for that particular program.

3. **Using manifest file**: If you are running a JAR file, you can specify the CLASSPATH in the JAR's manifest file. The manifest file contains information about the JAR file, including the CLASSPATH.

## Conclusion

Understanding the default CLASSPATH in Java is crucial for running Java programs. By default, Java includes the current working directory, Java platform classes, extension directories, and system-class libraries in the CLASSPATH. It is important to manage the CLASSPATH properly to include custom classes and libraries as per your requirements.
