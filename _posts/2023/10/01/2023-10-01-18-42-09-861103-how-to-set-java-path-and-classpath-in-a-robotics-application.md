When developing a robotics application in Java, it is important to set the *Java PATH* and *CLASSPATH* properly to ensure that your application can find and access the required Java libraries and dependencies. In this blog post, we will explore how to set these environment variables in a robotics application.

## Setting the Java PATH

The Java PATH is an environment variable that determines where the operating system looks for Java binaries and executables. To set the Java PATH, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Determine the location of your Java installation. This is typically the JDK (Java Development Kit) installation directory.

3. Set the PATH variable by using the following command:

```shell
export PATH=/path/to/java/bin:$PATH
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/java` with the actual path to your Java installation directory.

4. Verify the Java PATH by typing the following command in the terminal:

```shell
java -version
```

You should see the Java version information, confirming that the Java PATH has been set correctly.

## Setting the Java CLASSPATH

The Java CLASSPATH is an environment variable that specifies the location of Java classes and libraries used by your application. To set the Java CLASSPATH, follow these steps:

1. Determine the location of your Java libraries and dependencies that your robotics application requires.

2. Set the CLASSPATH variable by using the following command:

```shell
export CLASSPATH=/path/to/lib1.jar:/path/to/lib2.jar:$CLASSPATH
```

Replace `/path/to/lib1.jar` and `/path/to/lib2.jar` with the actual paths to your libraries and dependencies. Separate multiple paths with colons (:) on Unix-like systems or semicolons (;) on Windows systems.

3. Verify the Java CLASSPATH by running your robotics application:

```shell
java com.example.RoboticsApplication
```

If your application runs successfully without any class or library not found errors, the Java CLASSPATH has been set correctly.

## Conclusion

Setting the Java PATH and CLASSPATH correctly is essential for ensuring that your robotics application can access the required Java binaries, executables, libraries, and dependencies. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can ensure that your application runs smoothly.
