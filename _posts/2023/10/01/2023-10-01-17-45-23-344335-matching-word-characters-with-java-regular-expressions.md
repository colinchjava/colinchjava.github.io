To match word characters using Java regular expressions, you can use the `\w` metacharacter. The `\w` metacharacter matches any word character, which includes alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and underscores (_).

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use Java regular expressions to match word characters:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class WordCharacterMatcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello there! This is an example sentence.";

        // Define the regular expression pattern
        String pattern = "\\w+";

        // Create a Pattern object
        Pattern regex = Pattern.compile(pattern);

        // Create a Matcher object
        Matcher matcher = regex.matcher(text);

        // Find and print all matches
        while (matcher.find()) {
            String match = matcher.group();
            System.out.println(match);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a string `text` that contains a sentence. We define a regular expression pattern `\w+`, which matches one or more word characters. We create a `Pattern` object using the `Pattern.compile()` method and pass in the pattern. Then, we create a `Matcher` object using the `regex.matcher()` method.

We can use the `matcher.find()` method to find all occurrences of the pattern in the text. The `matcher.group()` method retrieves the matched text as a string. Finally, we print out all the matches found in the text.

By using regular expressions in Java, you can easily match word characters or any other specific patterns within your text. This provides a flexible and efficient way to process and manipulate strings in your applications.
