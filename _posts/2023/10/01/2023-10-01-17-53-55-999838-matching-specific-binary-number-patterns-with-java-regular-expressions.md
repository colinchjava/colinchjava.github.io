Java is a popular programming language that provides robust support for regular expressions. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Java regular expressions to match specific binary number patterns.

Let's say we want to match a binary number pattern that starts with a "1" and is followed by five "0" or "1" digits. We can define a regular expression pattern to achieve this:

```java
String binaryPattern = "1[01]{5}";
```

In this pattern, "1" matches the literal character "1", while "[01]{5}" matches any combination of five "0" or "1" digits.

To apply this regular expression pattern in Java, we can use the `matches()` method from the `java.util.regex.Pattern` class. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;

public class BinaryNumberPatternMatcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String binaryNumber = "101010";
        String binaryPattern = "1[01]{5}";

        // Create a Pattern object
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(binaryPattern);

        // Create a Matcher object
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(binaryNumber);

        // Check if the binary number matches the pattern
        if (matcher.matches()) {
            System.out.println("Binary number matches the pattern");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Binary number does not match the pattern");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a binary number `101010` and the binary pattern `1[01]{5}`. We compile the pattern into a `Pattern` object and then create a `Matcher` object using the binary number. We use the `matches()` method to check if the binary number matches the pattern, and based on the result, we print an appropriate message.

You can now run the Java code and observe the output based on different binary numbers and patterns.

Using regular expressions, you can create even more complex patterns to match various binary number patterns. Regular expressions can be a powerful tool when working with text patterns, no matter if they are in binary or any other format.
