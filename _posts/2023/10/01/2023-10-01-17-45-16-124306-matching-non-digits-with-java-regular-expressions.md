To begin, we need to import the `java.util.regex` package which contains the classes and methods for working with regular expressions in Java. Here is an example of how to import the package:

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
```

Once we have imported the necessary classes, we can start using regular expressions. To match non-digit characters, we can use the `\D` pattern. The `\D` pattern is a shorthand character class that matches any character that is not a digit.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use regular expressions to match non-digit characters in a string:

```java
String input = "The number is 123456";
String pattern = "\\D";
Pattern regex = Pattern.compile(pattern);
Matcher matcher = regex.matcher(input);

StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
while (matcher.find()) {
    result.append(matcher.group());
}

System.out.println("Non-digit characters: " + result.toString());
```

In this example, we have a string `input` that contains a mix of digit and non-digit characters. We define the regular expression pattern `\D` which matches any non-digit character. We then compile the pattern into a regular expression and create a `Matcher` object with the `input` string. 

We use the `find()` method of the `Matcher` object to find the next occurrence of the pattern in the input string. Inside the loop, we append each non-digit character to a `StringBuilder` object called `result`. Finally, we print the `result` to see the non-digit characters found in the input string.

Executing the above code will output:

```
Non-digit characters: The number is 
```

As you can see, the regular expression successfully matched the non-digit characters in the input string.

Using regular expressions in Java provides a flexible and efficient way to match non-digit characters. By leveraging the power of regular expressions, developers can easily manipulate and process text in their Java applications.
