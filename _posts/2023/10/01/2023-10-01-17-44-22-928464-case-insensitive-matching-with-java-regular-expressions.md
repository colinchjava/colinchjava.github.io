To perform case-insensitive matching in Java regular expressions, we can use the `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE` flag or the `(?i)` flag within the regular expression pattern.

Here's an example that demonstrates case-insensitive matching using both approaches:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class CaseInsensitiveMatching {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello World";
        String pattern = "(?i)hello";

        // Using Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE flag
        Pattern p1 = Pattern.compile(pattern, Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
        Matcher m1 = p1.matcher(text);
        System.out.println("Using Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE:");
        while (m1.find()) {
            System.out.println("Match found at index: " + m1.start());
        }

        // Using (?i) flag within the pattern
        Pattern p2 = Pattern.compile(pattern);
        Matcher m2 = p2.matcher(text);
        System.out.println("Using (?i) flag within the pattern:");
        while (m2.find()) {
            System.out.println("Match found at index: " + m2.start());
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, we have a text string containing "Hello World" and we are searching for the word "hello" in a case-insensitive manner. 

The first approach demonstrates using the `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE` flag when compiling the regular expression pattern. The `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE` flag enables case-insensitive matching. We create a `Pattern` object `p1` and a `Matcher` object `m1` to perform the matching operation. The `find()` method of the `Matcher` object is called inside a `while` loop to find all occurrences of the pattern. We then print the starting index of each match.

The second approach demonstrates using the `(?i)` flag within the regular expression pattern itself. The `(?i)` flag at the beginning of the pattern sets the case-insensitive mode for the entire pattern. We create another `Pattern` object `p2` and a `Matcher` object `m2` to perform the matching operation. Similar to the first approach, we use the `find()` method and print the starting index of each match.

Both approaches will produce the same output:

```
Using Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE:
Match found at index: 0
Using (?i) flag within the pattern:
Match found at index: 0
```

By using either the `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE` flag or the `(?i)` flag within the regular expression pattern, we can easily perform case-insensitive matching in Java regular expressions. This technique can be very useful when dealing with textual data that may have inconsistent casing.
