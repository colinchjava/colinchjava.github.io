In order to run a video streaming service using Java, it is essential to properly set up the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables. The PATH specifies where the Java JDK (Java Development Kit) is located, while the CLASSPATH defines the location of external libraries or class files required for the service to function correctly.

Setting up these variables is crucial for the service to be able to locate and access Java and its dependencies. Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the PATH and CLASSPATH for a video streaming service.

## Setting the Java PATH
1. Determine the directory where your Java JDK is installed. It could be something like `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.x.x_xx\bin` on Windows or `/usr/lib/jvm/java-x-openjdk/bin` on Linux.
2. Open the environment variables settings on your operating system. On Windows, you can right-click on "My Computer" or "This PC" and go to "Properties" -> "Advanced system settings" -> "Environment Variables." On Linux, you can edit the `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file.
3. In the "Environment Variables" window, navigate to the "System Variables" section and find the "PATH" variable.
4. Click "Edit" to modify the PATH variable. Add the directory path to your Java JDK installation at the end of the variable value. Separate multiple paths with a semicolon (;).
5. Save the changes and close the windows.

## Setting the Java CLASSPATH
1. Identify the locations of the external libraries or class files required for your video streaming service. These files could be located in a specific folder on your system or packaged with your service.
2. Open the environment variables settings as described above.
3. Create a new system variable called "CLASSPATH" if it does not already exist.
4. Set the value of the CLASSPATH variable to the locations of the external libraries or class files. Separate multiple paths with a semicolon (;).
5. Save the changes and close the windows.

Once the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables are correctly configured, your video streaming service should be able to locate and use Java and its dependencies without any issues.

Remember to restart any command prompt or terminal windows for the changes to take effect. You can verify if the Java PATH and CLASSPATH are set correctly by opening a command prompt or terminal and running the following commands:

```
java -version
javac -version
```

If the commands return the Java versions installed on your machine without any errors, then your PATH and CLASSPATH are properly configured.
