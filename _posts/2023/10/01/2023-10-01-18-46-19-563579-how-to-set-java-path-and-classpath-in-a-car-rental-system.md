When developing a car rental system in Java, it's essential to properly set the `PATH` and `CLASSPATH` environment variables. This ensures that your system can locate the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and any external libraries or classes required for your application to run smoothly.

## Setting the Java PATH

The `PATH` variable tells your operating system where to find executables, including the `java` command. To set the Java `PATH`, follow these steps:

1. Determine the location of your Java installation. By default, it is usually installed in the `Program Files` directory on Windows or the `/usr/lib/jvm` directory on Linux.
   
   **Example:**
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_261\bin`
   - Linux: `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin`

2. Open the system's **Environment Variables** settings.
   - On Windows, search for **Environment Variables** in the Start Menu and click on **Edit the system environment variables**.
   - On Linux, open a terminal and run the command `sudo nano /etc/environment`.

3. In the **Environment Variables** dialog, locate the **Path** variable, then click **Edit**.
   - On Linux, you may need to add the `export` command before each `PATH` entry.
   
4. Add the Java installation directory (from step 1) to the **Path** variable using the correct syntax for your operating system.
   
   **Windows Example:** `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_261\bin`
   
   **Linux Example:** `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin`

5. Click **OK** to save the changes.

## Setting the Java CLASSPATH

The `CLASSPATH` environment variable specifies the directories or JAR files where JVM (Java Virtual Machine) searches for classes. It allows your application to access external libraries or custom classes. To set the `CLASSPATH` variable, follow these steps:

1. Identify the external libraries or custom classes required for your car rental system.

2. Open the system's **Environment Variables** settings (similar to the steps mentioned in the previous section).

3. Locate the **CLASSPATH** variable in the **Environment Variables** dialog and click **Edit**.

4. Add the required directories or JAR files to the **CLASSPATH** variable, separated by a semicolon (`;`) on Windows or a colon (`:`) on Linux.

   **Example:**
   ```
   C:\path\to\library1.jar;C:\path\to\library2.jar
   ```
   
   **Linux Example:**
   ```
   /path/to/library1.jar:/path/to/library2.jar
   ```

5. Click **OK** to save the changes.

Setting the `PATH` and `CLASSPATH` ensures that your car rental system can be executed without any issues, allowing it to locate the JRE and required classes or libraries.
