When working with Java on Windows, it's important to set up the **PATH** and **CLASSPATH** environment variables correctly. These variables allow the operating system to locate the Java executables and libraries.

## Setting up the PATH variable

The **PATH** variable tells the operating system where to find executable files. Follow these steps to set up the Java PATH variable on Windows:

1. **Find the Java installation directory**: Open File Explorer and navigate to the location where Java is installed, typically `C:\Program Files\Java`. Look for the version-specific folder, such as `jdk1.8.0_271` for Java SE Development Kit 8.

2. **Copy the Java installation directory path**: Right-click on the folder and select *Properties*. In the *Properties* window, copy the *Location* field value, for example, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_271`.

3. **Add Java to the PATH variable**: Right-click on the *Start* button and select *System*. In the *System* window, click on *Advanced system settings* on the left-hand side. In the *System Properties* window, click on the *Environment Variables* button. 

4. In the *Environment Variables* window, find the **Path** variable under *System variables* and click on *Edit*. 

5. In the *Edit Environment Variable* window, click on *New* and paste the Java installation path that you copied earlier. Click *OK* to save the changes.

6. **Confirm the PATH setup**: Open a new Command Prompt window and type `java -version`. If you see the Java version printed, then the PATH setup was successful.

## Setting up the CLASSPATH variable

The **CLASSPATH** variable is used by the Java runtime to locate the class files that you compile or run. Follow these steps to set up the Java CLASSPATH variable on Windows:

1. **Identify the location of your Java application**: Determine the directory where your Java application's `.class` files are stored.

2. **Copy the application directory path**: Right-click on the folder containing your application's `.class` files and select *Properties*. In the *Properties* window, copy the *Location* field value.

3. **Set up the CLASSPATH variable**: Open the *Environment Variables* window by following the steps mentioned in the previous section. Under *System variables*, click on *New* to add a new variable. 

4. In the *Variable name* field, enter `CLASSPATH`. In the *Variable value* field, paste the application directory path that you copied earlier.

5. Click *OK* to save the changes.

## Conclusion

By correctly setting up the Java PATH and CLASSPATH variables on your Windows system, you ensure that the Java executables are easily accessible, and the Java runtime can find the necessary class files for your applications. Make sure to double-check your configuration by running `java -version` and verifying that the correct version is displayed.
