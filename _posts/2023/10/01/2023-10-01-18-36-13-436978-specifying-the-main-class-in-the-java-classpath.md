In order to resolve this issue, you need to ensure that you have correctly specified the main class in the CLASSPATH. Here's how you can do it:

1. Ensure that your Java code is compiled and there is a compiled bytecode file (with a .class extension) for your main class. For example, if your main class is named "MyMainClass", ensure that there is a corresponding "MyMainClass.class" file.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your compiled bytecode file is located.

3. Set the CLASSPATH environment variable to include the directory where your bytecode file is located. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   export CLASSPATH=.
   ```

   This sets the CLASSPATH to the current directory, where your bytecode file resides.

4. Run your Java application using the `java` command, specifying the fully qualified name of your main class. For example:

   ```
   java com.example.MyMainClass
   ```

   Here, "com.example" is the package name (if any) and "MyMainClass" is the name of the main class.

By following these steps, you ensure that the JVM can locate and execute your main class without encountering any "NoClassDefFoundError" or "ClassNotFoundException" issues.

Remember to replace "com.example.MyMainClass" with the actual package and class names relevant to your Java application. This is just an example to illustrate the steps.
