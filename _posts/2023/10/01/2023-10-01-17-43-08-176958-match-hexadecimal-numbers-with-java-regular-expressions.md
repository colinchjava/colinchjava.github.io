In Java, regular expressions can be used to match and extract hexadecimal numbers from a given input string. Hexadecimal numbers consist of a prefix "0x" followed by a sequence of digits from 0 to 9 and letters from A to F (case insensitive).

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to match hexadecimal numbers using Java regular expressions:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class HexadecimalMatcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "This is a sample input containing some hexadecimal numbers like 0x1A3F and 0x7B.";

        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("0x[0-9A-Fa-f]+");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);

        while (matcher.find()) {
            String hexNumber = matcher.group();
            System.out.println("Hexadecimal number found: " + hexNumber);
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we define the regular expression pattern `0x[0-9A-Fa-f]+`. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the pattern represents:

- `0x`: This matches the prefix "0x" that precedes the hexadecimal number.
- `[0-9A-Fa-f]`: This character class matches any digit from 0 to 9, or any letter from A to F (both uppercase and lowercase).
- `+`: This indicates that there must be at least one occurrence of the preceding character class.

We use the `Pattern` class from the `java.util.regex` package to compile the regular expression pattern. Then, we create a `Matcher` object and initialize it with the input string. The `find()` method is used to search for matches, and the `group()` method returns the matched hexadecimal number.

Running the above code will output:

```
Hexadecimal number found: 0x1A3F
Hexadecimal number found: 0x7B
```

By using regular expressions in Java, you can easily identify and extract hexadecimal numbers from a given input string. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to process or validate such numeric values in your application.
