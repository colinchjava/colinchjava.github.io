If you are deploying a Java application to a Heroku dyno, you might need to set the Java `PATH` and `CLASSPATH` environment variables to ensure that your application can access the necessary Java runtime and libraries.

## Java PATH
The Java `PATH` variable is used by the operating system to locate the Java executable. To set the Java `PATH` on a Heroku dyno, follow these steps:

1. Open your Heroku dashboard and navigate to your application.
2. Go to the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "Config Vars" section.
3. Click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
4. Add a new key-value pair:
   - Key: `JAVA_HOME`
   - Value: `/app/.jdk`
5. Click on the "Add" button to save the new configuration variable.

## Java CLASSPATH
The Java `CLASSPATH` variable is used by the Java runtime to locate the classes and libraries required by your application. To set the Java `CLASSPATH` on a Heroku dyno, you can use a buildpack that automatically sets the `CLASSPATH` variable based on your application's dependencies.

Heroku supports a buildpack called `heroku-buildpack-runnable-jar` that sets the `CLASSPATH` for Java applications deployed as runnable JAR files. To use this buildpack, follow these steps:

1. Open your Heroku dashboard and navigate to your application.
2. Go to the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "Buildpacks" section.
3. Click on the "Add buildpack" button.
4. Add the URL of the `heroku-buildpack-runnable-jar` buildpack:
   ```
   https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-runnable-jar.git
   ```
5. Click on the "Save changes" button.

The `heroku-buildpack-runnable-jar` buildpack automatically detects your runnable JAR file and sets the `CLASSPATH` accordingly.

That's it! Your Java application deployed on a Heroku dyno should now have the correct `PATH` and `CLASSPATH` configurations. You can verify this by checking the logs of your Heroku application during the deployment process.
