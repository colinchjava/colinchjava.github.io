To set the Java PATH and CLASSPATH in a data analytics tool, follow these steps:

1. **Locate your Java installation directory:** Determine the directory where Java is installed on your system. This directory contains the executable files needed to run Java programs.

2. **Set the Java PATH:** The Java PATH environment variable tells the operating system where to find the Java executables. To set the Java PATH:
   - Open the command prompt or terminal.
   - **Windows**: Type the following command and replace `<java_installation_directory>` with the actual path to your Java installation directory:
     ```batch
     SET PATH=%PATH%;<java_installation_directory>\bin
     ```
   - **Unix/Linux/Mac**: Type the following command and replace `<java_installation_directory>` with the actual path to your Java installation directory:
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:<java_installation_directory>/bin
     ```

3. **Set the Java CLASSPATH:** The Java CLASSPATH environment variable lists the directories or JAR files where Java should look for classes and resources. To set the Java CLASSPATH:
   - Open the command prompt or terminal.
   - **Windows**: Type the following command and replace `<classpath_entries>` with the directories or JAR files you want to include:
     ```batch
     SET CLASSPATH=<classpath_entries>
     ```
   - **Unix/Linux/Mac**: Type the following command and replace `<classpath_entries>` with the directories or JAR files you want to include:
     ```bash
     export CLASSPATH=<classpath_entries>
     ```

*Note: Make sure to replace `<classpath_entries>` in step 3 with the appropriate values. Separate multiple entries with a semicolon on Windows or a colon on Unix/Linux/Mac.*

By setting the Java PATH and CLASSPATH correctly, your data analytics tool will be able to locate and utilize the Java runtime environment and any additional libraries or dependencies required for your analysis.
