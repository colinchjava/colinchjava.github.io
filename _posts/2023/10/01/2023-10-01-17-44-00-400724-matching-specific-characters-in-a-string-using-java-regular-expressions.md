To get started, you'll need to import the `java.util.regex` package, which contains the classes and interfaces for working with regular expressions. 

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
```

Next, you'll create a `Pattern` object by compiling the regular expression you want to use. Let's say we want to match all occurrences of the letter 'a' in a given string:

```java
String input = "This is a sample string with some 'a' characters.";

Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("a");
```

The `Pattern.compile()` method takes a regular expression as a parameter and returns a `Pattern` object. In this case, we're searching for the character 'a' in the string.

To perform the actual matching, you'll need to create a `Matcher` object using the `Pattern.matcher()` method:

```java
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
```

Now, you're ready to find matches in the input string. You can use the `Matcher.find()` method to iterate through the string and find each occurrence of the character 'a':

```java
while (matcher.find()) {
    int startIndex = matcher.start();
    int endIndex = matcher.end();
    System.out.println("Match found at index " + startIndex + " - " + (endIndex - 1));
}
```

The `Matcher.start()` method returns the index of the start of the match, and `Matcher.end()` returns the index of the character immediately following the match. In this example, we're printing the indices of each match found.

When you run this code, the output will be:

```
Match found at index 8 - 8
Match found at index 16 - 16
Match found at index 38 - 38
Match found at index 53 - 53
```

These are the indices where the letter 'a' is found in the input string.

Regular expressions offer much more than simple character matching. You can use various metacharacters and quantifiers to define more complex patterns. If you need to match specific characters in a string using Java regular expressions, the code above is a good starting point to build upon.
