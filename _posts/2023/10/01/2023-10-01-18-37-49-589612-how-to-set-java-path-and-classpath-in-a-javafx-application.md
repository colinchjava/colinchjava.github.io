## What is Java PATH?
The Java PATH is an environment variable that tells the operating system where to find the Java executable files. When you run a Java application from the command line, the operating system looks for the Java executable based on this PATH variable.

## Setting Java PATH and CLASSPATH in a JavaFX application
To set the Java PATH and CLASSPATH in a JavaFX application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Locate the Java installation directory
In order to set the Java PATH and CLASSPATH, you need to know the location of your Java installation directory. Typically, it can be found in `C:\Program Files\Java` on Windows or `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` on macOS.

### Step 2: Set the Java PATH
- **Windows**: Right-click on "Computer" or "My Computer" and select "Properties". Click on "Advanced system settings", then click on "Environment Variables". Under "System variables", locate the "Path" variable and click on "Edit". Add the path to the Java installation directory at the beginning of the variable value, separating it from the existing entries with a semicolon.
- **macOS**: Open a terminal window and run the following command: 
```shell
export PATH="/path/to/java/bin:$PATH"
```


### Step 3: Set the Java CLASSPATH
The Java CLASSPATH is used to specify the location of classes and libraries that your Java application depends on. If your JavaFX application uses external libraries, you need to include them in the CLASSPATH.

To set the CLASSPATH, open a text editor and create a new file. Add the following line to the file, replacing `/path/to/lib` with the path to the library or JAR file:
```shell
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/lib
```

Save the file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `classpath.sh`), and then run the following command in the terminal to set the CLASSPATH:
```shell
source /path/to/classpath.sh
```


## Conclusion
In this blog post, we have learned how to set the Java PATH and CLASSPATH in a JavaFX application. By properly setting these variables, you can ensure that your JavaFX application can find and use the required Java libraries and dependencies. Remember to always test your application after setting the PATH and CLASSPATH to ensure everything is working as expected.
