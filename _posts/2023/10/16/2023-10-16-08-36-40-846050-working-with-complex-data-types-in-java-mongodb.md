MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that allows you to store and retrieve data in a flexible and document-oriented format. In MongoDB, you can store complex data types such as arrays, nested objects, and embedded documents. In this article, we will explore how to work with these complex data types in Java using the MongoDB Java driver.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you need to have the following:

- MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or a remote server.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- MongoDB Java driver added as a dependency in your Java project.

## Connecting to MongoDB

First, let's establish a connection to the MongoDB server using the MongoDB Java driver. Here's an example:

```java
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;

public class MongoDBExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Connect to MongoDB server
        MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://localhost:27017");
        
        // Access the "mydb" database
        MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydb");
        
        // Perform operations on the database
        // ...
        
        // Close the connection
        mongoClient.close();
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace "mongodb://localhost:27017" with the appropriate connection string for your MongoDB server.

## Storing complex data types

To store complex data types in MongoDB, we can use the `Document` class provided by the MongoDB Java driver. The `Document` class allows you to create and manipulate documents in a key-value format.

Here's an example of storing an array and a nested object in a MongoDB document:

```java
import org.bson.Document;

// ...

Document document = new Document();
document.append("name", "John Doe");
document.append("age", 30);
document.append("hobbies", Arrays.asList("reading", "gaming", "traveling"));

Document address = new Document();
address.append("street", "123 Main Street");
address.append("city", "New York");
address.append("country", "USA");

document.append("address", address);

// Insert the document into a MongoDB collection
MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("users");
collection.insertOne(document);
```

In this example, we create a `Document` object and populate it with various fields including an array of hobbies and a nested object representing the address. We then insert this document into a MongoDB collection called "users" using the `insertOne()` method.

## Retrieving complex data types

To retrieve complex data types from MongoDB, we can use the `get()` method of the `Document` class and cast the value to the appropriate data type.

Here's an example of retrieving and printing the stored document:

```java
Document retrievedDocument = collection.find().first();

String name = retrievedDocument.getString("name");
int age = retrievedDocument.getInteger("age");
List<String> hobbies = retrievedDocument.getList("hobbies", String.class);

Document retrievedAddress = retrievedDocument.get("address", Document.class);
String street = retrievedAddress.getString("street");
String city = retrievedAddress.getString("city");
String country = retrievedAddress.getString("country");

System.out.println("Name: " + name);
System.out.println("Age: " + age);
System.out.println("Hobbies: " + hobbies);
System.out.println("Address: " + street + ", " + city + ", " + country);
```

In this example, we use the `find()` method to retrieve the first document from the "users" collection. We then extract the values of various fields from the retrieved document using the `get()` method and print them to the console.

## Conclusion

Working with complex data types in Java MongoDB is made easy with the help of the MongoDB Java driver. You can store and retrieve arrays, nested objects, and embedded documents using the `Document` class. This flexibility allows you to model and manipulate your data in a way that suits your application's needs.

By leveraging these features, you can build powerful and scalable applications that make the most out of the NoSQL capabilities provided by MongoDB.
