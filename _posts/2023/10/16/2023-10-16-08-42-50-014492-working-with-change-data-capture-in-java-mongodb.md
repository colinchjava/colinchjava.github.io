## Introduction

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a feature that allows you to track the changes happening in your MongoDB database in real-time. With CDC, you can capture and process every insert, update, and delete operation performed on your data, providing valuable insights and enabling you to react promptly to any changes that occur.

In this blog post, we will explore how to work with Change Data Capture in Java using MongoDB. We will cover the basic concepts, setup requirements, and provide an example code snippet to get you started.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- MongoDB server setup and running
- MongoDB Java driver version 3.12.0 or higher

## Getting Started

To work with Change Data Capture in Java MongoDB, you need to include the `mongo-java-driver` dependency in your project. You can do this by adding the following Maven dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongo-java-driver</artifactId>
    <version>3.12.9</version>
</dependency>
```

## Enabling Change Data Capture

To enable Change Data Capture in MongoDB, you need to configure the MongoDB server with the replication feature. To do this, you need to start the MongoDB server as a replica set. You can follow the official MongoDB documentation to set up a replica set.

Once you have a replica set up and running, you can enable Change Data Capture on a specific collection by running the following command in the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
db.collection.watch()
```

This will enable Change Data Capture for the specified collection, and you will start receiving the change events in real-time.

## Working with Change Data Capture in Java

To work with Change Data Capture in Java, you need to create a MongoDB Change Stream cursor and process the change events it receives.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to create a Change Stream cursor using the Java MongoDB driver:

```java
MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://localhost:27017");
MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydb");
MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("mycollection");

Bson filter = Filters.in("operationType", "insert", "update", "delete");

MongoCursor<ChangeStreamDocument<Document>> cursor = collection.watch().filter(filter).iterator();

while (cursor.hasNext()) {
    ChangeStreamDocument<Document> changeStreamDocument = cursor.next();
    Document data = changeStreamDocument.getFullDocument();
    // Process the change event...
}
```

In the above example, we first create a MongoDB client, connect to the desired database, and obtain a reference to the collection we want to monitor for changes. We then define a filter to only capture insert, update, and delete operations.

Next, we create a Change Stream cursor by calling `watch()` on the collection and filtering it based on our defined filter. We then iterate over the cursor and process each change event.

Inside the loop, we can access the full document that was inserted, updated or deleted using the `getFullDocument()` method of the `ChangeStreamDocument` object. We can then perform any necessary processing based on the specific change event.

## Conclusion

Change Data Capture in Java MongoDB provides a powerful mechanism to track and react to real-time changes in your data. In this blog post, we explored the basics of working with Change Data Capture in Java, including the setup requirements and an example code snippet.

By leveraging Change Data Capture, you can build reactive applications that respond to changes in your data more effectively, enabling real-time updates and analytics.
