MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that allows you to store and retrieve data in a flexible manner. In addition to its document-based structure, MongoDB also supports transactions, which enable you to perform multiple operations on multiple collections in an atomic manner.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to use transactions with multiple collections in Java MongoDB. We'll cover the following topics:

1. MongoDB Transaction Basics
2. Starting a Transaction in Java
3. Performing Operations on Multiple Collections
4. Committing or Aborting a Transaction
5. Error Handling in Transactions
6. Conclusion

Let's dive into each of these topics in more detail.

## MongoDB Transaction Basics

A transaction is a group of operations that need to be executed together as a single unit. In MongoDB, a transaction guarantees that either all the operations within the transaction are applied successfully or none of them are applied.

Transactions in MongoDB are supported from version 4.0 onwards and require a replica set or a sharded cluster to function.

## Starting a Transaction in Java

To start a transaction in Java, you need to acquire a session object from the MongoDB client. The session object provides a context in which the transaction operates.

```java
MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(connectionString);
ClientSession session = mongoClient.startSession();
session.startTransaction();
```

## Performing Operations on Multiple Collections

To perform operations on multiple collections within a transaction, you need to use the session object to run these operations. Here's an example of how you can insert a document into two collections within a single transaction:

```java
MongoCollection<Document> collection1 = database.getCollection("collection1");
MongoCollection<Document> collection2 = database.getCollection("collection2");

Document doc1 = new Document("key1", "value1");
Document doc2 = new Document("key2", "value2");

session.insert(collection1.getNamespace(), doc1);
session.insert(collection2.getNamespace(), doc2);
```

## Committing or Aborting a Transaction

Once you have performed the desired operations within a transaction, you can choose to either commit or abort the transaction.

To commit a transaction, you need to call the `commitTransaction` method on the session object:

```java
session.commitTransaction();
```

To abort a transaction, you need to call the `abortTransaction` method on the session object:

```java
session.abortTransaction();
```

## Error Handling in Transactions

MongoDB transactions provide built-in error handling capabilities. If any operation within a transaction fails, the transaction is automatically aborted and an exception is thrown.

When performing operations within a transaction, it's important to handle exceptions properly to ensure that the transaction is managed correctly. You can use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions thrown during transaction operations.

```java
try {
    // Perform transaction operations
    session.commitTransaction();
} catch (MongoException e) {
    // Handle exception and abort transaction
    session.abortTransaction();
} finally {
    // Cleanup session resources
    session.close();
}
```

## Conclusion

Using transactions with multiple collections in Java MongoDB allows you to ensure data consistency and reliability. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can start incorporating transactions into your MongoDB applications.

MongoDB's transaction support provides a powerful mechanism for managing complex operations across multiple collections. It's important to handle exceptions properly and follow best practices to ensure the reliability and integrity of your data.

With these capabilities, you can build robust and scalable applications using Java MongoDB that meet your evolving data management needs.
