MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides support for multi-document transactions. With multi-document transactions, you can perform atomic operations on multiple documents, ensuring consistency and data integrity across multiple collections or databases.

In this article, we will explore how to work with multi-document transactions in Java MongoDB. We will cover the steps required to begin and commit transactions and also how to handle exceptions and rollbacks.

## Setting up MongoDB and the Java MongoDB Driver

Before we dive into working with multi-document transactions, we need to make sure that we have MongoDB installed and a MongoDB Java driver added to our project dependencies. 

To install MongoDB, you can visit the official website of MongoDB and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

To add the MongoDB Java driver to your project, you can include the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.5</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, you can download the JAR file of the MongoDB Java driver from the official MongoDB website and add it to your project manually.

## Starting a Transaction

To start a multi-document transaction in Java MongoDB, you need to create a `ClientSession` object using the `MongoClients` class. 

```java
MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(MongoClientSettings.builder().build());
ClientSession session = mongoClient.startSession();
```

## Performing Operations

Once you have the `ClientSession` object, you can perform operations on your collections within the transaction. These operations can include inserting, updating, or deleting documents.

```java
MongoCollection<Document> collection = session.getDatabase("yourDatabase").getCollection("yourCollection");
collection.insertOne(session, new Document("_id", 1).append("name", "John Doe"));
```

You can perform multiple operations on different collections using the same `ClientSession` object.

## Committing the Transaction

To commit the transaction and make the changes permanent, you can use the `commitTransaction()` method of the `ClientSession` object. 

```java
session.commitTransaction();
```

It's important to note that once the transaction is committed, all the changes made within the transaction are applied to the database.

## Handling Exceptions and Rollbacks

In case of any exception during the transaction, you should handle the exception and rollback the changes to maintain data integrity. To rollback a transaction, you can use the `abortTransaction()` method of the `ClientSession` object.

```java
try {
    // Perform operations within the transaction
    session.commitTransaction();
} catch (Exception e) {
    session.abortTransaction();
    throw e;
} finally {
    session.close();
}
```

In the code above, if any exception occurs while performing operations, the transaction is rolled back and the exception is rethrown. Finally, the session is closed to release resources.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to work with multi-document transactions in Java MongoDB. We saw how to start a transaction, perform operations, commit the transaction, and handle exceptions and rollbacks.

With multi-document transactions, you can ensure consistency and data integrity across multiple collections or databases in MongoDB, making it a powerful feature for building robust and reliable applications.

For more details and advanced usage of multi-document transactions, you can refer to the official MongoDB documentation.
