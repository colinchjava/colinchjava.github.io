MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides scalability and high-performance for applications. One of the key features of MongoDB is sharding, which allows distributing data across multiple servers or shards to handle large amounts of data and heavy workloads. In this blog post, we will explore how to use sharding in MongoDB with Java.

## Introduction to Sharding

Sharding is a technique used to horizontally partition data across multiple servers or shards. Each shard contains a subset of the data, and collectively they form a distributed database. This allows MongoDB to handle large datasets by spreading the workload across multiple servers.

## Getting Started

To use sharding in Java MongoDB, we need to include the MongoDB Java driver in our project. You can add the driver as a Maven dependency by adding the following code to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongo-java-driver</artifactId>
    <version>3.12.9</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, you can download the JAR file from the MongoDB website and add it to your project manually.

## Enabling Sharding

Before we can start using sharding, we need to enable it on our MongoDB server. This can be done by connecting to the server and executing the following command:

```java
MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient("localhost", 27017);
MongoDatabase adminDb = mongoClient.getDatabase("admin");
adminDb.runCommand(new Document("enableSharding", "mydatabase"));
```

Replace "mydatabase" with the name of your database. This command enables sharding for the specified database.

## Creating Sharded Collection

After enabling sharding, we can create a sharded collection. A sharded collection is a collection that is distributed across multiple shards. To create a sharded collection, we need to define a shard key that determines how data is partitioned. 

```java
MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydatabase");
database.createCollection("mycollection");

Document shardKey = new Document("name", "hashed");
Document createShardedCollCmd = new Document("shardCollection", 
    "mydatabase.mycollection")
    .append("key", shardKey);

adminDb.runCommand(createShardedCollCmd);
```

In the above code, we first create a regular collection called "mycollection" in the "mydatabase" database. Then, we define a shard key using the "name" field of the documents in the collection. Finally, we run the `shardCollection` command to make the "mycollection" collection sharded.

## Querying Sharded Data

Once the data is distributed across shards, we can query it as usual using the MongoDB Java driver. The driver will automatically route the queries to the appropriate shards based on the shard key.

```java
MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("mycollection");

Document query = new Document("name", "John Doe");
FindIterable<Document> result = collection.find(query);

for (Document document : result) {
    System.out.println(document.toJson());
}
```

In the above code, we create a query to find documents with the name "John Doe" in the "mycollection" collection. The result is an iterable that contains the matching documents. We can iterate over the result and print the documents.

## Conclusion

Sharding is a powerful feature of MongoDB that allows distributing data across multiple servers to handle large-scale applications. In this blog post, we learned how to use sharding in MongoDB with Java. We covered enabling sharding, creating sharded collections, and querying sharded data using the MongoDB Java driver.

By leveraging sharding, you can scale your MongoDB deployments to handle increasing data volumes and provide better performance for your applications.
