Change history, or change data capture, is a powerful feature in databases that allows you to track and capture changes made to data. In Java MongoDB, you can easily work with change history using the Change Streams feature.

## What is Change Streams?

Change Streams is a feature in MongoDB that allows you to receive real-time notifications of changes made to the data in a MongoDB cluster. It provides a way to subscribe to changes happening in the database and react accordingly.

## Enabling Change Streams in Java MongoDB

To work with change history in Java MongoDB, you first need to enable Change Streams on your MongoDB cluster. This can be done by configuring the replica set and enabling the oplog.

Once you have enabled Change Streams, you can start using it in your Java application.

## Using Change Streams in Java

To use Change Streams in Java, you need to configure a change stream pipeline and subscribe to the changes. Here's an example code snippet to demonstrate the process:

```java
MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://localhost:27017");
MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydb");

MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("mycollection");

List<Bson> pipeline = Arrays.asList(
    Aggregates.match(Filters.in("operationType", "insert", "update", "delete")),
    Aggregates.project(Projections.fields(
        Projections.include("documentKey", "operationType"),
        Projections.excludeId()
    ))
);

MongoCursor<ChangeStreamDocument<Document>> cursor = collection.watch(pipeline).iterator();

while (cursor.hasNext()) {
    ChangeStreamDocument<Document> document = cursor.next();
    Document documentKey = document.getDocumentKey();
    String operationType = document.getOperationType();

    // Do something with the change
    // ...

    System.out.println("Received change: " + documentKey + ", " + operationType);
}

cursor.close();
mongoClient.close();
```

In this example, we create a MongoDB client and get the desired database and collection. Then, we define a change stream pipeline using the `Aggregates.match()` and `Aggregates.project()` stages to filter and project the desired fields from the change stream.

Next, we create a cursor by calling the `watch()` method on the collection with the pipeline. We use this cursor to iterate over the changes and perform the desired actions on each change.

Finally, we close the cursor and the MongoDB client.

## Conclusion

Change Streams in Java MongoDB provide a convenient way to work with change history in your application. You can easily track and react to data changes happening in your MongoDB cluster in real-time. By enabling Change Streams and using the provided Java API, you can take advantage of this powerful feature to build data-driven applications.
