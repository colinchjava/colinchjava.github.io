Relational databases have been popular for decades, but with the rise of big data and unstructured data, NoSQL databases like MongoDB have become more prevalent. MongoDB is a popular document database that allows flexible and schema-less data storage.

In this blog post, we will explore how to handle database connections in Java with MongoDB, using the official MongoDB Java driver.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
2. MongoDB installed and running locally or on a remote server
3. MongoDB Java driver added as a dependency to your Java project

## Connecting to MongoDB

To connect to MongoDB from Java, you need to instantiate a `MongoClient` object. Here's an example code snippet to establish a connection:

```java
import com.mongodb.MongoClient;
import com.mongodb.MongoClientURI;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;

public class MongoDBExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a MongoClientURI with the connection details
        MongoClientURI connectionString = new MongoClientURI("mongodb://localhost:27017");

        // Create a MongoClient using the connection string
        MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(connectionString);

        // Access the database
        MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydatabase");

        // Perform database operations
        // ...

        // Close the connection
        mongoClient.close();
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create a `MongoClientURI` object that specifies the connection details such as the host and port. Then, we create a `MongoClient` using the `MongoClientURI`. Finally, we get a reference to the database using `mongoClient.getDatabase("mydatabase")` and perform any desired database operations.

## Error Handling and Resource Cleanup

As with any database connection, it's important to handle exceptions and ensure proper resource cleanup. Here's an updated version of the previous code snippet that demonstrates proper error handling and resource cleanup using try-with-resources:

```java
import com.mongodb.MongoClient;
import com.mongodb.MongoClientURI;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;

public class MongoDBExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MongoClientURI connectionString = new MongoClientURI("mongodb://localhost:27017");

        try (MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(connectionString)) {
            MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydatabase");

            // Perform database operations
            // ...
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle exceptions
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In the updated version, we use a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the `MongoClient` object and release any associated resources, ensuring proper cleanup even if an exception occurs.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've explored how to handle database connections in Java with MongoDB using the official MongoDB Java driver. We've covered establishing a connection, performing database operations, and handling exceptions. Remember to always handle exceptions and clean up resources properly to ensure reliable and efficient database interactions.

Implementing MongoDB in Java opens up a world of possibilities for handling unstructured data and building scalable applications. Give it a try and see the power of MongoDB in your Java projects!
