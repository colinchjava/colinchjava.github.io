MongoDB offers a feature called **tailable cursors**, which allows applications to continuously retrieve new documents that are being added to a collection. This is particularly useful for scenarios where we want to react in real-time to changes in the database.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use tailable cursors in a Java application with MongoDB.
Before diving into the code, make sure you have the MongoDB Java driver installed in your project.

**Step 1: Creating a Tailable Cursor**

To create a tailable cursor, we need to set the `cursorType` option to `TailableAwait` when querying the collection. Here's an example:

```java
MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient("localhost", 27017);
MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("test");
MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("myCollection");

FindIterable<Document> iterable = collection.find().cursorType(CursorType.TailableAwait);
MongoCursor<Document> cursor = iterable.iterator();

while (cursor.hasNext()) {
    Document document = cursor.next();
    System.out.println(document);
}
```

In the above code snippet, we first connect to the MongoDB server and retrieve a reference to the desired collection (`myCollection`). We then create a `FindIterable` by calling the `find()` method on the collection and set the `cursorType` option to `TailableAwait`. Finally, we obtain an iterator from the `FindIterable` and iterate over the cursor to retrieve the new documents as they arrive.

**Step 2: Inserting new documents**

To see the tailable cursor in action, we need to insert some documents into the collection. Here's an example:

```java
Document document1 = new Document("name", "John");
collection.insertOne(document1);
```

In the above code snippet, we create a new `Document` object representing the data we want to insert. We then call the `insertOne()` method on the collection and pass the `Document` as an argument to insert it into the database.

**Step 3: Observing real-time changes**

Now, if we run the above code snippet with the tailable cursor, it will continuously output new documents added to the collection in real-time.

**Note:** Tailable cursors are not supported on standalone MongoDB deployments. They require a replica set or a sharded cluster for their operation.

That's it! Now you know how to use tailable cursors in a Java application with MongoDB. This feature can be extremely useful in scenarios where real-time data processing is required, such as log monitoring or real-time analytics.

For more information, you can refer to the official MongoDB documentation on [Tailable Cursors](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/tailable-cursors/).
