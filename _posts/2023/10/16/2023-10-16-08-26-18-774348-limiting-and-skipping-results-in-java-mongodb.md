MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides flexible querying capabilities. Sometimes, when working with large datasets, we may want to limit the number of results returned or skip a certain number of results. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this using the Java MongoDB driver.

## Setting up the MongoDB Java Driver

First, we need to set up the MongoDB Java driver in our project. You can add the following Maven dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
  <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>
  <version>4.2.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, if you are using Gradle, you can add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-sync:4.2.3'
```

Make sure to sync your project dependencies after adding the MongoDB driver.

## Limiting Results

To limit the number of results returned by a MongoDB query, we can use the `limit()` method. This method takes an integer argument specifying the maximum number of documents to return.

Here's an example of how to limit the results to 10 documents using the Java MongoDB driver:

```java
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoCollection;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoCursor;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;
import org.bson.Document;

public class MongoDBExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (var mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://localhost:27017")) {
            var database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydb");
            var collection = database.getCollection("mycollection");

            var cursor = collection.find().limit(10).iterator();
            while (cursor.hasNext()) {
                var document = cursor.next();
                // Process the document
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a MongoDB client and connect to the local MongoDB server running on the default port. We specify the database name as `"mydb"` and the collection name as `"mycollection"`.

We then use the `limit()` method with an argument of `10` to limit the results to 10 documents. We retrieve the documents using the `find()` method and iterate over them using a `MongoCursor`.

## Skipping Results

Sometimes we may want to skip a certain number of results and retrieve documents starting from a specific position. MongoDB provides the `skip()` method to achieve this.

Here's an example of how to skip the first 5 documents and retrieve the remaining documents using the Java MongoDB driver:

```java
var cursor = collection.find().skip(5).iterator();
while (cursor.hasNext()) {
    var document = cursor.next();
    // Process the document
}
```

In this example, we use the `skip()` method with an argument of `5` to skip the first 5 documents. We then retrieve the remaining documents and process them as needed.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to limit and skip results when querying MongoDB using the Java MongoDB driver. We learned how to limit the number of documents returned using the `limit()` method and how to skip a certain number of documents using the `skip()` method.

These techniques can be useful when working with large datasets and needing to paginate or refine the results returned from a MongoDB query.
