MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides high scalability and flexibility for storing and retrieving data. Starting from version 4.0, MongoDB also introduced support for multi-document transactions, making it even more suitable for transactional applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle transactions in Java MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
2. MongoDB server running locally or remotely with version 4.0 or above.
3. Maven or Gradle installed for dependency management.

## Setting up MongoDB Connection

To connect to MongoDB from a Java application, we need to add the MongoDB Java driver dependency to our project. If you are using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>
    <version>4.4.3</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-sync:4.4.3'
```

Next, let's create a MongoDB client and connect to the MongoDB server:

```java
import com.mongodb.*;
import com.mongodb.client.*;

public class MongoDBConnection {
    private static MongoClient mongoClient;
    private static MongoDatabase database;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://localhost:27017");
        database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydb");

        // Perform operations...
    }
}
```

Replace `mongodb://localhost:27017` with your MongoDB server connection URI. Also, you can replace `"mydb"` with your own database name.

## Handling Transactions

To handle transactions in Java MongoDB, we need to make use of the `ClientSession` class provided by the MongoDB Java driver. Here's an example of how to perform a transaction:

```java
import com.mongodb.*;
import com.mongodb.client.*;
import org.bson.*;
import com.mongodb.client.model.*;
import com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;
import static com.mongodb.client.model.Updates.*;

public class MongoDBTransaction {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ClientSession session = mongoClient.startSession()) {
            session.startTransaction();

            try {
                MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("mycollection");

                // Perform operations within the transaction
                collection.insertOne(session, new Document("name", "John Doe"));
                collection.updateOne(session, eq("name", "John Doe"), set("age", 30));
                collection.deleteOne(session, eq("age", 30));

                session.commitTransaction();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                session.abortTransaction();
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The above code starts a new transaction by calling `session.startTransaction()`. Within the transaction, we can perform various operations on the `MongoCollection` using the provided `session` object. Once all the operations are successfully executed, we call `session.commitTransaction()` to commit the changes. If any exception occurs during the transaction, we call `session.abortTransaction()` to roll back the changes.

## Conclusion

Handling transactions in Java MongoDB is made possible with the introduction of multi-document transactions in MongoDB 4.0 and above. By using the `ClientSession` object and the provided methods, we can perform multiple operations in a transaction and ensure atomicity and consistency in our application.
