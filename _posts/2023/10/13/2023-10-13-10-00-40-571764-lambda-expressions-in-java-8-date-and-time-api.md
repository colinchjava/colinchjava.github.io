In Java 8, the Date and Time API has been introduced to provide a more streamlined and efficient way of working with dates and times. One of the most powerful features of Java 8 is the ability to use lambda expressions with the Date and Time API. Lambda expressions allow you to write more concise and expressive code when working with date and time calculations.

## Why use Lambda expressions?

Before diving into lambda expressions in the Date and Time API, let's first understand why they are useful. 

Lambda expressions provide a way to write shorter and more readable code by allowing you to express instances of anonymous functions that can be passed around as parameters or stored in variables. This makes your code more modular, flexible, and easier to understand.

## Lambda expressions in the Date and Time API

The Java 8 Date and Time API provides several functional interfaces that can be used with lambda expressions. These interfaces include `TemporalAdjuster`, `TemporalQuery`, and `TemporalAccessor`. These interfaces define methods that can be implemented using lambda expressions for custom date and time calculations.

Let's look at an example of using lambda expressions with the Date and Time API to calculate the next working day:

```java
import java.time.*;

public class WorkingDayCalculator {

    private static TemporalAdjuster nextWorkingDay = (temporal) -> {
        DayOfWeek dayOfWeek = DayOfWeek.from(temporal);
        int daysToAdd = 1;
        if (dayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.FRIDAY) {
            daysToAdd = 3;
        } else if (dayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.SATURDAY) {
            daysToAdd = 2;
        }
        return temporal.plus(daysToAdd, ChronoUnit.DAYS);
    };

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
        LocalDate nextWorkingDay = today.with(nextWorkingDay);
        System.out.println("Next working day: " + nextWorkingDay);
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `TemporalAdjuster` called `nextWorkingDay` using a lambda expression. The `nextWorkingDay` lambda expression takes a `Temporal` object (such as a `LocalDate`) and returns the next working day.

The lambda expression checks the day of the week and adds the appropriate number of days to get the next working day. If the day is Friday, it adds three days to skip the weekend, and if the day is Saturday it adds two days.

Finally, we use the `with` method of the `LocalDate` class along with the `nextWorkingDay` `TemporalAdjuster` to calculate and print the next working day.

## Conclusion

Lambda expressions in the Java 8 Date and Time API provide a powerful way to write concise and expressive code when working with dates and times. By using lambda expressions, you can simplify your code and make it more modular and flexible. The ability to use lambda expressions with the Date and Time API is just one of the many improvements introduced in Java 8, making it a significant update for Java developers.
