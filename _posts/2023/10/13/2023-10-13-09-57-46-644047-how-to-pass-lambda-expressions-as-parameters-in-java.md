Lambda expressions in Java allow you to pass a block of code as a parameter to a method. This feature enables you to create more concise and functional code. In this blog post, we will explore how to pass lambda expressions as parameters in Java.

## Introduction
Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 as a way to express instances of functional interfaces concisely. A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method. By passing lambda expressions as parameters, we can define behavior at the call site, making our code more flexible and modular.

## Passing Lambda Expressions
To pass a lambda expression as a parameter in Java, you need to have a method that accepts a functional interface as its parameter type. This functional interface should have a single abstract method whose signature matches the lambda expression.

## Lambda Expressions Syntax
The syntax for a lambda expression consists of three main parts: parameters, an arrow token (`->`), and a body. The parameters represent the inputs to the lambda expression, the arrow token separates the parameters from the body, and the body contains the code to be executed when the lambda expression is invoked.

Here is the general syntax for lambda expressions:

```java
(parameter1, parameter2, ...) -> {
    // code to be executed
}
```

## Example: Sorting a List
Let's illustrate the concept of passing lambda expressions as parameters with an example of sorting a list of integers in descending order.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.add(5);
        numbers.add(2);
        numbers.add(8);
        numbers.add(1);
        numbers.add(9);

        Collections.sort(numbers, (a, b) -> b - a);

        System.out.println(numbers); // Output: [9, 8, 5, 2, 1]
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `Collections.sort()` method to sort the list `numbers`. We pass a lambda expression `(a, b) -> b - a` as the second parameter to specify the custom sorting order. The lambda expression subtracts `a` from `b`, resulting in a descending order.

## Conclusion
Passing lambda expressions as parameters in Java provides a powerful way to pass behavior to methods and create more concise and flexible code. By understanding the syntax of lambda expressions and how to use them, you can leverage this feature to write more expressive and efficient Java code.
