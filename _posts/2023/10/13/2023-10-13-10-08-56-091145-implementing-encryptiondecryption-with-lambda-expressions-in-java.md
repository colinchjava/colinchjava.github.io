In this tech blog post, we will explore how to implement encryption and decryption functionality using lambda expressions in Java. Lambda expressions are a powerful feature introduced in Java 8 that allow us to write more concise and expressive code.

## Introduction

Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a secret coded format, whereas decryption is the reverse process of converting the encoded text back to its original form. There are various encryption algorithms available, such as AES, RSA, and DES. In this example, we will use a simple Caesar cipher algorithm to demonstrate the encryption and decryption process.

## Encryption with Lambda Expressions

First, let's define a functional interface `EncryptionFunction` with a single method `encrypt`, which takes a character as input and returns the encrypted character. We can use a lambda expression to implement this interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface EncryptionFunction {
    char encrypt(char c);
}

EncryptionFunction encryptor = (char c) -> {
    // Encryption logic goes here
    // For example, using a Caesar cipher to shift each character by 3 positions
    return (char) (c + 3);
};

char encryptedChar = encryptor.encrypt('A'); // Returns 'D'
```

In the above code, we define a lambda expression that takes a character `c` and returns `(char) (c + 3)`, which shifts the character by 3 positions in the Unicode table.

## Decryption with Lambda Expressions

To decrypt the encrypted character, we can define another functional interface `DecryptionFunction` with a method `decrypt` that takes the encrypted character as input and returns the original character:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface DecryptionFunction {
    char decrypt(char encryptedChar);
}

DecryptionFunction decryptor = (char encryptedChar) -> {
    // Decryption logic goes here
    // For example, using a Caesar cipher to shift each character back by 3 positions
    return (char) (encryptedChar - 3);
};

char decryptedChar = decryptor.decrypt('D'); // Returns 'A'
```

In the above code, we define a lambda expression that takes an encrypted character `encryptedChar` and returns `(char) (encryptedChar - 3)`, which shifts the character back by 3 positions to get the original character.

## Conclusion

Lambda expressions provide a convenient and concise way to implement encryption and decryption functionality in Java. While this example demonstrates a simple Caesar cipher algorithm, you can apply similar concepts to more complex encryption algorithms. By leveraging the power of lambda expressions, you can write cleaner and more expressive code.

I hope this blog post has given you an insight into implementing encryption and decryption with lambda expressions in Java. Feel free to explore more advanced encryption algorithms and experiment with lambda expressions to enhance your code!
