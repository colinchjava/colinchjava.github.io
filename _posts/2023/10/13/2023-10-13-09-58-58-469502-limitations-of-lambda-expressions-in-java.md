Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 to provide
a concise way of writing code by representing
anonymous functions. However, there are certain limitations
to consider when using lambda expressions in Java.

## Inability to Access Instance Variables and Non-Final Local Variables

Lambda expressions can only access local variables that are
effectively final, meaning they cannot be modified after being
initialized. This is because lambda expressions capture the value
of these variables when they are created, and they need to ensure
that the captured value remains constant.

If you attempt to access instance variables or non-final local
variables within a lambda expression, you will encounter a
compilation error. To work around this limitation, you can either
declare the variables as final or effectively final, or use
instance variables of a class through the `this` keyword.

## Lack of Explicit Type Declarations

Another limitation of lambda expressions is the lack of explicit
type declarations. In Java, the type inference system can usually
determine the type of the lambda parameters based on the context
in which they are used. However, in some cases, the type is
ambiguous, and you need to provide an explicit type declaration.

Type inference may also result in unexpected behavior when
overloaded methods are involved. In such cases, explicitly
specifying the parameter types in the lambda expression can
help clarify the intended behavior.

## Limited Support for Checked Exceptions

Lambda expressions in Java have limited support for checked
exceptions. When using lambda expressions in functional
interfaces that declare checked exceptions, you have two options:

1. Handle the checked exception within the lambda expression
   using a try-catch block. This can make the lambda expression
   less concise and cluttered.

2. Wrap the lambda expression inside another functional
   interface that does not declare any checked exception. This
   can be done using a lambda expression or a method reference
   that catches and handles the checked exception.

## Absence of Method Overloading

Lambda expressions can only be used with functional interfaces.
A functional interface is an interface that declares a single
abstract method. This means that you cannot use method overloading
with lambda expressions directly.

To use different behaviors for different parameter types, you
either need to define multiple functional interfaces with matching
methods or create a single functional interface with generic types.
This can lead to more verbose code and reduced readability.

## Conclusion

While lambda expressions provide a powerful way to write
concise and expressive code in Java, they do have certain limitations.
The inability to access instance variables and non-final local
variables, lack of explicit type declarations, limited support for
checked exceptions, and absence of method overloading are some of
the limitations you may encounter. Understanding these limitations
can help you make informed decisions when using lambda expressions
in your Java projects.
