## Introduction to Blockchain Technology

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. It ensures transparency, security, and eliminates the need for intermediaries. A blockchain network consists of blocks, which contain a list of transactions. Each block is linked to the previous block through a cryptographic hash.

## Implementing Blockchain in Java

To implement a basic blockchain in Java, we need to define classes for Block, Transaction, and Blockchain. The Block class represents an individual block, the Transaction class represents a transaction, and the Blockchain class manages the blocks.

Here is an example of the Block class:

```java
public class Block {
    private String previousHash;
    private String hash;
    private List<Transaction> transactions;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
```

The Transaction class can be defined as follows:

```java
public class Transaction {
    private String sender;
    private String receiver;
    private double amount;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
```

And the Blockchain class can be implemented as:

```java
public class Blockchain {
    private List<Block> blocks;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
    // Method to add a new block
    // Method to validate the blockchain
}
```

## Using Lambda Expressions for Blockchain Operations

Lambda expressions in Java provide a concise way to work with functional interfaces. We can leverage lambda expressions to perform blockchain operations such as adding transactions to blocks and validating the blockchain.

Let's see an example of using lambda expressions to add transactions to a block in the Blockchain class:

```java
public void addTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
    blocks.stream()
          .filter(block -> block.getTransactions().size() < MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_BLOCK)
          .findFirst()
          .ifPresent(block -> block.getTransactions().add(transaction));
}
```

In the code snippet above, we use a lambda expression to filter the blocks based on the number of transactions they contain. We then find the first block that has available space and add the transaction to it.

Similarly, we can use lambda expressions to validate the blockchain by checking if each block's hash matches the previous block's hash:

```java
public boolean validate() {
    return IntStream.range(1, blocks.size())
                    .allMatch(i -> blocks.get(i).getPreviousHash().equals(blocks.get(i - 1).getHash()));
}
```

Here, we use the `allMatch` method of the `IntStream` to iterate over the list of blocks and check if each block's previousHash matches the hash of the previous block.

## Conclusion

Lambda expressions in Java provide a powerful tool for working with blockchain technology. By leveraging lambda expressions, we can perform various blockchain operations efficiently and concisely. This allows us to build robust and secure applications using blockchain technology. Start exploring lambda expressions in Java to enhance your blockchain development skills!
