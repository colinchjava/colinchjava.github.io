In modern web development, working with JSON data is a common task. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. In Java, we can use libraries like Jackson or Gson to work with JSON data. Additionally, Java 8 introduced the concept of lambda expressions, which allow us to write more concise and expressive code. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with JSON data using lambda expressions in Java.

## What is JSON?

JSON is a text-based format for representing structured data. It is widely used for data interchange between a client and a server, or between different systems. JSON data is represented as a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be strings, numbers, boolean values, arrays, or objects. Here is an example of a JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

## Working with JSON in Java

To work with JSON data in Java, we can use libraries like Jackson or Gson. These libraries provide APIs to parse JSON data into Java objects and serialize Java objects into JSON data.

### Parsing JSON

Here is an example of parsing JSON data using Jackson:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

String json = "{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"age\":30,\"email\":\"johndoe@example.com\"}";

ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
MyObject myObject = objectMapper.readValue(json, MyObject.class);
```

In this example, we use the `ObjectMapper` class from the Jackson library to parse the JSON data into a Java object of type `MyObject`.

### Serializing Java Objects to JSON

Here is an example of serializing a Java object to JSON using Gson:

```java
import com.google.gson.Gson;

MyObject myObject = new MyObject("John Doe", 30, "johndoe@example.com");

Gson gson = new Gson();
String json = gson.toJson(myObject);
```

In this example, we use the `Gson` class from the Gson library to serialize the Java object `myObject` into a JSON string.

## Using Lambda Expressions with JSON

Lambda expressions in Java allow us to write inline functions or "function literals". They are a powerful addition to the Java language and can make working with JSON data more concise and expressive.

### Filtering JSON Data

Let's say we have a list of JSON objects representing persons, and we want to filter out persons over a certain age. Using lambda expressions, we can easily achieve this:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

String json = "[{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"age\":30,\"email\":\"johndoe@example.com\"}, {\"name\":\"Jane Smith\",\"age\":25,\"email\":\"janesmith@example.com\"}]";

List<MyObject> persons = objectMapper.readValue(json, new TypeReference<List<MyObject>>() {});

List<MyObject> filteredPersons = persons.stream()
    .filter(person -> person.getAge() <= 30)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

In this example, we use the `filter` method of the `Stream` class to only keep persons whose age is less than or equal to 30.

### Transforming JSON Data

We can also use lambda expressions to transform JSON data. Let's say we have a list of JSON objects representing products, and we want to calculate the total price of all the products. Here is how we can do it:

```java
import com.google.gson.Gson;

String json = "[{\"name\":\"Product 1\",\"price\":10.99}, {\"name\":\"Product 2\",\"price\":5.99}]";

List<Product> products = gson.fromJson(json, new TypeToken<List<Product>>() {}.getType());

double totalPrice = products.stream()
    .mapToDouble(Product::getPrice)
    .sum();
```

In this example, we use the `mapToDouble` method of the `Stream` class to map each product to its price, and then use the `sum` method to calculate the total price.

## Conclusion

Working with JSON data is a common task in Java, and using libraries like Jackson or Gson can facilitate this process. Additionally, lambda expressions can make working with JSON data more concise and expressive. By leveraging the power of lambda expressions, we can easily filter and transform JSON data in our Java applications.
