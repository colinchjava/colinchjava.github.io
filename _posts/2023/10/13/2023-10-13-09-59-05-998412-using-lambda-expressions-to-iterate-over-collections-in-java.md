When working with collections in Java, it is often necessary to perform some operation on each element of the collection. Traditionally, this is done using a loop structure like the `for` or `foreach` loop. However, with the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 8, a more concise and expressive approach is now available.

Lambda expressions provide a way to define anonymous functions that can be passed as arguments or stored in variables. They are particularly useful when working with functional interfaces, which are interfaces that have a single abstract method.

To iterate over a collection using lambda expressions, you can use the `forEach` method provided by the `Iterable` interface. This method takes a functional interface as an argument and applies it to each element in the collection. Here's an example:

```java
List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange");

fruits.forEach(fruit -> System.out.println(fruit));
```

In this example, we have a list of fruits and we use the `forEach` method to iterate over each fruit in the list. We pass a lambda expression as the argument, which takes a single parameter `fruit` and prints it to the console using `System.out.println`.

You can also use method references in combination with lambda expressions to further simplify the code. For example, if you have a method that performs a specific operation on a fruit, you can reference that method directly instead of defining a lambda expression. Here's an example:

```java
fruits.forEach(System.out::println);
```

In this case, we use the method reference `System.out::println` as the argument to `forEach`, which is equivalent to using a lambda expression that calls `System.out.println`.

Lambda expressions provide a concise and expressive way to iterate over collections in Java, making the code more readable and reducing boilerplate. They are especially useful when working with functional interfaces, allowing you to perform operations on each element of a collection in a more declarative manner.

For more information on lambda expressions in Java, you can refer to the official Java documentation on [Lambda Expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html).
