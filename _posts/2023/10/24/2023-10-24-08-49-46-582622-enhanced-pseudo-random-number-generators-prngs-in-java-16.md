Java 16 introduces significant enhancements to the existing pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) in the `java.util.random` package. These improvements provide better randomness and increased performance compared to previous versions of Java.

## Introduction to PRNGs

A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is an algorithm that generates a sequence of numbers that appear to be random but are actually determined by an initial value called the seed. The same seed will always produce the same sequence of numbers, making the generated sequence deterministic.

## Previous PRNGs in Java

In previous versions of Java, the `java.util.Random` class provided a basic implementation of a PRNG. While it served its purpose for many applications, it had some limitations. One limitation was the sequential nature of the generated numbers, which could introduce predictability and decreased security in certain scenarios.

## New PRNGs in Java 16

Java 16 introduces two new enhanced PRNG algorithms: `L64X128Plus` and `Xoshiro256StarStar`. These PRNGs offer improved randomness and better performance compared to their predecessors.

### L64X128Plus

The `L64X128Plus` algorithm, as the name suggests, uses 64-bit state and generates 128 bits of output at a time. This algorithm is designed to provide excellent statistical quality and is suitable for a wide range of applications, including numerical simulations, gaming, and cryptography.

To create an instance of `L64X128Plus` PRNG, you can use the following code:

```java
RandomGenerator random = RandomGeneratorFactory.createRandomGenerator("L64X128Plus");
```

### Xoshiro256StarStar

The `Xoshiro256StarStar` algorithm is an improved version of the original `Xoshiro256**` PRNG. It features enhanced state transitions, resulting in better statistical quality and significantly faster generation of random numbers. This algorithm is particularly useful in performance-critical applications where random numbers are required in high volumes.

To create an instance of `Xoshiro256StarStar` PRNG, you can use the following code:

```java
RandomGenerator random = RandomGeneratorFactory.createRandomGenerator("Xoshiro256StarStar");
```

## Setting the Seed

To set the seed for the PRNG, you can use the `setSeed` method available in the `RandomGenerator` interface. For example:

```java
random.setSeed(42);
```

This will initialize the PRNG with the seed value of 42.

## Conclusion

The enhanced PRNGs introduced in Java 16 provide improved randomness and performance compared to previous versions. These algorithms offer better statistical quality and are suitable for a wide range of applications. By using the new PRNGs, developers can enhance the security and reliability of their applications that rely on random number generation.
