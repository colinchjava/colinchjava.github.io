Java 17, the latest release in the Java programming language, comes with several security enhancements that aim to improve the overall security posture of Java applications. In this blog post, we will explore some of these key security features.

## Enhanced Certificate Checking

Java 17 introduces enhanced certificate checking to ensure that certificates used for secure communication are more rigorously validated. This enhancement strengthens the trustworthiness of the communication and prevents potential attacks that exploit weak or compromised certificates. With this improvement, Java applications can now better defend against man-in-the-middle attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

To enable enhanced certificate checking, developers can use the `jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms` system property to specify algorithms that should be disabled for certificate validation.

Example:

```java
System.setProperty("jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms", "MD2, RSA keySize < 2048");
```

## Context-Specific Root Certificates

Another significant security improvement in Java 17 is the addition of context-specific root certificates. With this enhancement, Java applications can have separate root certificate stores for different context settings, such as user-centric applications and system-level applications. This feature allows for better isolation and control over the trusted certificate authorities used in specific contexts.

To utilize context-specific root certificates, developers need to configure the `java.security.properties` file with the appropriate settings.

Example:

```java
javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=JKS
javax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/keystore.jks
javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=JKS
javax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/truststore.jks
```

## Deprecation of GC Algorithm APIs

Java 17 deprecates various Garbage Collection (GC) algorithm-related APIs. These APIs are deemed unsafe and pose risks such as denial-of-service attacks and potential security vulnerabilities. By deprecating them, the Java development team encourages the use of newer and more secure GC algorithms.

Developers are advised to update their applications to use the recommended GC algorithms and follow the latest best practices provided by the JDK documentation.

## Conclusion

Java 17 brings important security enhancements that improve the security and robustness of Java applications. By enabling enhanced certificate checking and introducing context-specific root certificates, developers can bolster the security of their applications by validating certificates more rigorously and controlling trust at different levels. Additionally, deprecating unsafe GC algorithm APIs ensures that applications use the most secure and efficient garbage collection techniques.

It is crucial for developers to stay updated with the latest Java releases and implement these security enhancements to ensure the safety and integrity of their applications.
