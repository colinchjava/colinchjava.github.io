In the latest release of Java 17, one of the significant changes is the strong encapsulation of JDK internals. This means that certain internal APIs, which were previously accessible to developers, are now encapsulated and are not intended to be used directly.

## What is strong encapsulation?

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that allows the hiding of implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities. Strong encapsulation takes this concept further by enforcing strict access control to prevent direct access to internal components or implementation details.

## Why strong encapsulation in Java?

The main motivation behind introducing strong encapsulation in Java is to ensure the long-term maintainability, security, and performance of the platform. By encapsulating internal APIs, the Java platform becomes more robust against changes, bug fixes, and other modifications made to the internals without impacting the stability of external applications.

Encapsulating internal APIs also helps to improve security by preventing malicious code from gaining access to sensitive internal resources. It reduces the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities by limiting the exposure of internal implementation details.

## Changes in Java 17

In Java 17, several internal APIs have been encapsulated and are now inaccessible from external code. These include:

1. sun.misc.Unsafe: This class provided low-level access to memory operations, such as direct memory manipulation, thread synchronization, and object allocation. With strong encapsulation, direct use of this class is no longer possible, making the JVM more secure and less prone to errors caused by incorrect usage.

2. sun.reflect.ReflectionFactory, sun.reflect.Reflection: These classes were commonly used by libraries and frameworks for reflective operations, such as creating instances of classes, invoking methods, and accessing fields. With encapsulation, direct access to these classes is restricted, promoting the use of public APIs provided by the Java Reflection API.

3. com.sun.management: Several internal management APIs related to monitoring and managing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) have been encapsulated. These APIs were mainly intended for JVM implementation and monitoring tools rather than regular application development.

## Impact on developers

For most developers, the strong encapsulation of JDK internals in Java 17 might have little to no impact on their existing codebase. However, if your code heavily relies on any of the encapsulated APIs mentioned above, you will need to find alternative solutions. In most cases, the recommended approach is to use the supported public APIs provided by the Java platform.

## Conclusion

With the strong encapsulation of JDK internals in Java 17, the platform becomes more robust, secure, and maintainable. Encapsulating internal APIs reduces the risk of unintended dependencies and strengthens the overall stability of Java applications. While it may require some modifications to existing codebases that rely on the encapsulated APIs, it ultimately helps to promote best practices and encourages the use of official APIs for improved compatibility and future-proofing. #Java #Encapsulation
