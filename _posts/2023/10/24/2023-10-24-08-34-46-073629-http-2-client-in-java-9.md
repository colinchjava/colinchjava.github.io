## Introduction to HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is a major revision of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It introduces several improvements over its predecessor, HTTP/1.1, including faster page loading, reduced latency, and better bandwidth utilization. 

## Setting up the HTTP/2 Client in Java 9
To enable the HTTP/2 client in Java 9, you need to add the following module to your project's module descriptor (module-info.java):

```java
module com.example {
    requires jdk.incubator.httpclient;
}
```

Once you've added the module, you can start using the HTTP/2 client in your code.

## Making HTTP/2 Requests
Creating an HTTP/2 client request is straightforward. Here's an example that sends a GET request to a remote server:

```java
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;

public class HttpClientExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(new URI("https://example.com"))
                .build();
        HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandler.asString());
        System.out.println(response.body());
    }
}
```
In the above code, we create an instance of `HttpClient` using `HttpClient.newHttpClient()`. We then create an `HttpRequest` object with the desired URL and finally send the request using `httpClient.send()`. The response is obtained as an `HttpResponse` object.

## Handling HTTP/2 Responses
The `HttpResponse` object contains various information about the response, including the response code, headers, and body. Here's an example of how you can extract this information:

```java
HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandler.asString());

int responseCode = response.statusCode();
String responseBody = response.body();

System.out.println("Response Code: " + responseCode);
System.out.println("Response Body: " + responseBody);
```

## Benefits of the HTTP/2 Client in Java 9
Here are some key benefits of using the HTTP/2 client in Java 9:

1. **Improved Performance:** The HTTP/2 protocol offers significant improvements over HTTP/1.1, such as multiplexing, header compression, and server push, resulting in faster and more efficient communication.

2. **Simplified API:** The HTTP/2 client API in Java 9 provides a simple and intuitive way to make HTTP/2 requests without the need for external dependencies or libraries.

## Conclusion
Java 9's built-in HTTP/2 client provides developers with a powerful tool to leverage the benefits of the HTTP/2 protocol in their applications. In this blog post, we explored how to set up the HTTP/2 client in Java 9 and make requests. We also discussed the benefits it offers, such as improved performance and a simplified API.
