With the release of Java 10, a major change was introduced in the structure of the Java Development Kit (JDK) repositories. Prior to Java 10, the JDK source code was split across multiple repositories, making it difficult to navigate and contribute to the development process. Java 10 addressed this issue by consolidating the repositories into a single repository, easing the development and maintenance of the JDK.

## The Problem with Multiple Repositories

Before the consolidation, the JDK source code was scattered across various repositories, such as `jdk7u`, `jdk8u`, `jdk9`, `corba`, `jaxp`, `jaxws`, etc. Each repository represented a different version or component of the JDK. This structure posed several challenges:

1. **Complexity**: It was cumbersome to navigate and understand the interdependencies between different repositories. Developers often had to clone multiple repositories and keep them in sync manually.

2. **Contributions**: Contributing to the development of the JDK required separate commits in different repositories, which was time-consuming and error-prone.

3. **Maintenance**: Maintaining and updating the JDK source code across multiple repositories was a complex task, making it difficult to ensure consistency and compatibility across versions.

## Consolidation Benefits

The consolidation of JDK repositories in Java 10 addressed these challenges and brought several benefits:

1. **Simplified Development**: With a single, unified repository, developers can easily navigate the entire JDK source code. This allows them to understand the codebase better and contribute more effectively.

2. **Streamlined Contributions**: Consolidating the repositories enables developers to make changes and contribute to the JDK in a more streamlined manner. They no longer have to juggle different repositories or worry about keeping their changes in sync manually.

3. **Easier Maintenance**: Having a single repository simplifies the task of maintaining and updating the JDK source code. It ensures that changes are consistent across the entire JDK, reducing compatibility issues between different components.

## How to Access the Consolidated Repository

The consolidated JDK repository can be accessed through the OpenJDK project, which hosts the open-source implementation of Java. The repository includes the entire JDK source code, historical versions, and ongoing development.

To access the consolidated repository, you can clone it using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openjdk/jdk.git
```

## Conclusion

The consolidation of JDK repositories in Java 10 was a significant improvement in the development and maintenance process. It simplified the structure of the JDK source code, making it easier for developers to contribute and navigate the codebase. By consolidating all the JDK components into a single repository, Java 10 ensured better consistency, compatibility, and ease of maintenance.
