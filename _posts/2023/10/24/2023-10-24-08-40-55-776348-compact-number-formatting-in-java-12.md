In Java 12, a new feature was introduced to format numbers in a more compact and localized way. This feature allows you to express large numbers in a concise format suitable for display in limited-sized UI elements or in scenarios where space is a constraint.

To use the compact number formatting feature, you can use the `CompactNumberFormat` class, which is available in the `java.text` package. This class provides methods to format and parse compact numbers based on the locale provided.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use compact number formatting in Java 12:

```java
import java.text.CompactNumberFormat;
import java.util.Locale;

public class CompactNumberFormattingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 12001;
        
        CompactNumberFormat compactNumberFormat = CompactNumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance(Locale.US, CompactNumberFormat.CompactStyle.SHORT);
        String compactFormattedNumber = compactNumberFormat.format(number);
        
        System.out.println("Compact Formatted Number: " + compactFormattedNumber);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `CompactNumberFormat` by passing the desired locale (`Locale.US`) and the compact style (`CompactNumberFormat.CompactStyle.SHORT`) as arguments to the `getCompactNumberInstance` method. The `CompactStyle.SHORT` style produces compact numbers like "12K" or "1.2M".

We then format the given number (`12001`) using the `format` method of `CompactNumberFormat` and store the result in the `compactFormattedNumber` variable. Finally, we print the compact formatted number to the console.

To run this code, you need to make sure you have Java 12 or a higher version installed on your machine.

By using compact number formatting, you can present large numbers in a more concise and visually appealing way. This can be particularly helpful in user interfaces with limited space or when displaying data in a more user-friendly manner.

You can find more information about compact number formatting in the official Java documentation:
