Java 20 introduces a new feature called pattern matching for sealed classes, which allows for more concise and expressive code when working with sealed classes. Sealed classes are classes that have a fixed set of subclasses defined at compile-time, and pattern matching allows for easier handling of these subclasses.

## What are Sealed Classes?

Sealed classes are a type of class that restricts the number of permissible subclasses. In Java, sealed classes are defined using the `sealed` modifier, and subclasses are declared using the `non-sealed` modifier.

Sealed classes provide a way to enforce a restricted hierarchy and ensure that only a specific set of classes can extend the sealed class. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to control the inheritance hierarchy to maintain encapsulation and prevent other classes from extending the sealed class.

## Pattern Matching for Sealed Classes

With the introduction of pattern matching in Java 20, working with sealed classes has become more convenient. Pattern matching simplifies the process of writing code that handles different subclasses of a sealed class in a concise and readable manner.

Here is an example that demonstrates how pattern matching can be used with sealed classes:

```java
sealed interface Shape {
    record Circle(double radius) implements Shape {}
    record Rectangle(double length, double width) implements Shape {}
}

public double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
    if (shape instanceof Circle c) {
        return Math.PI * Math.pow(c.radius(), 2);
    } else if (shape instanceof Rectangle r) {
        return r.length() * r.width();
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown shape: " + shape);
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we have a sealed interface `Shape` with two implementing records: `Circle` and `Rectangle`. The `calculateArea` method uses pattern matching to determine the type of the `Shape` object and performs the appropriate calculations based on the specific subclass.

## Benefits of Pattern Matching for Sealed Classes

Pattern matching offers several benefits when working with sealed classes:

1. **Concise code:** Pattern matching allows for compact and readable code by eliminating the need for explicit type casting or instanceof checks.
2. **Improved maintainability:** Pattern matching makes it easier to handle different subclasses of a sealed class, enabling better code organization and maintainability.
3. **Enhanced encapsulation:** The restricted hierarchy enforced by sealed classes promotes encapsulation and prevents unauthorized extension of the sealed class.

## Conclusion

Pattern matching for sealed classes is a valuable addition to Java 20, offering developers a more elegant and streamlined way of working with sealed classes. By simplifying the handling of different subclasses, pattern matching enhances code readability and maintainability, while enforcing encapsulation. It's an exciting feature that Java developers can leverage to write cleaner and more expressive code.
