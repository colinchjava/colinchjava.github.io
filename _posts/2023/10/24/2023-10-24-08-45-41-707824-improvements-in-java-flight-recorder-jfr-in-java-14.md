Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a monitoring and profiling tool that comes with the Java Development Kit (JDK). It allows developers to collect and analyze data from running Java applications with minimal impact on performance. With each new release, Java continues to improve JFR to provide better insights into application behavior and performance. In Java 14, several enhancements have been made to JFR. Let's take a look at some of the key improvements:

## 1. Flight Recorder Event Streaming
Java 14 introduces a new API called `JfrEventStreaming` that allows developers to stream JFR events in real-time. This feature enables applications to consume JFR events as they are being generated, providing the ability to react and respond to performance issues or anomalies as they occur.

Using the `JfrEventStreaming` API, developers can create event streams and attach consumers to process the events. This is especially useful for scenarios where immediate actions need to be taken based on the collected data.

## 2. Continuous Monitoring with JFR Start/Stop APIs
Java 14 introduces new APIs for starting and stopping JFR recordings programmatically. The `FlightRecorder` class now provides methods to control the recording lifecycle. Developers can start, stop, and check the recording status using these APIs.

This enhancement allows applications to implement continuous monitoring by starting and stopping JFR recordings based on specific conditions or triggers. For example, an application might start a recording when CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold or stop a recording when memory usage drops below a particular level.

## 3. Better Control over Continuous Dumping
Java 14 introduces new options that provide more control over continuous memory dumping in JFR. With the new `-XX:StartFlightRecording=dumponexit=true` option, JFR will automatically dump the recorded data upon JVM exit. This ensures that data is not lost in critical situations where the JVM unexpectedly terminates.

Previously, continuous dumping was not available by default, and developers had to manually configure and trigger memory dumps at regular intervals. This improvement simplifies the process and provides additional reliability for capturing and analyzing JFR data.

## 4. Enhanced Method Profiling
JFR in Java 14 includes significant improvements in method profiling. The method profiling data now includes information about the bytecode instructions executed within a method. This allows developers to gain deeper insights into method behavior and performance.

With the enhanced method profiling, developers can identify performance bottlenecks, inefficient code sections, or hotspots within their applications more accurately. This information can then be used to optimize the code and improve overall application performance.

## Conclusion
Java 14 brings notable enhancements to Java Flight Recorder, empowering developers to gather even more precise and real-time insights into their Java applications. The new event streaming capabilities, start/stop APIs, improved continuous dumping, and enhanced method profiling enable developers to monitor and analyze application performance with greater flexibility and accuracy. These improvements enhance the developer experience and make it easier to optimize Java applications for better performance and reliability.
