In Java 12, several enhancements have been made to the Garbage Collector (GC) to improve the performance and scalability of Java applications. In this article, we will explore some of these improvements and their impact on overall GC behavior.

## Introduction to Garbage Collection in Java

Garbage Collection is a process in Java that automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use by the program. It helps in managing memory efficiently, eliminating manual memory management, and ensuring the safety and stability of Java applications.

## ZGC - Concurrent Garbage Collector

Java 12 introduced ZGC as an experimental feature, which is a scalable, low-latency garbage collector designed for large heap sizes. ZGC performs garbage collection concurrently, meaning that it runs concurrently with the application threads, resulting in minimal pause times. This makes it suitable for applications with high throughput requirements and strict latency requirements.

ZGC offers several benefits, including low-pause times, high scalability, and support for both small and large heap sizes. It can handle heaps ranging from a few hundred megabytes to several terabytes, making it ideal for modern, memory-intensive applications.

To enable ZGC, you can use the `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseZGC` command-line options. Please note that ZGC is still considered experimental in Java 12 and may not be suitable for production environments.

## Epsilon - No-op Garbage Collector

Another experimental feature introduced in Java 12 is Epsilon, a no-op garbage collector. Epsilon is designed for applications that do not require heap memory to be reclaimed, meaning it does not perform any actual garbage collection. It allows applications to run without any pause times for GC, making it useful for scenarios where predictable, steady performance is desired.

Epsilon can be enabled using the `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseEpsilonGC` command-line options. However, it is important to understand that Epsilon is not meant for general-purpose applications and should only be used in specific use cases where memory allocation and deallocation are not critical.

## Other GC Improvements

Apart from the experimental features mentioned above, Java 12 also includes various enhancements to existing garbage collectors. These improvements primarily focus on reducing GC pause times and improving the overall efficiency of garbage collection.

Some of the improvements include:

1. Low-pause times for the G1 garbage collector.
2. Better management of reference objects in the CMS garbage collector.
3. Smoother interaction between the garbage collector and the compiler, leading to improved performance.

## Conclusion

Java 12 brings several improvements to the Garbage Collector, including the introduction of the new ZGC and Epsilon GCs, as well as various enhancements to existing garbage collectors. These improvements aim to provide better performance, scalability, and low-pause times for Java applications. As always, it is important to thoroughly evaluate and test these features before using them in production environments.
