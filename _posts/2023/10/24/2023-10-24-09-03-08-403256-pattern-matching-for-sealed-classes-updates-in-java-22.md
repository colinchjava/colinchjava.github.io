Java 22 introduces a powerful new feature called pattern matching for sealed classes, which allows for more concise and expressive code when working with sealed classes. Sealed classes, introduced in Java 15, provide a way to restrict the set of subclasses that can extend a class or implement an interface. Pattern matching makes it easier to work with sealed classes by providing a streamlined syntax for handling different subclasses.

## What are sealed classes in Java?

Sealed classes are a way to define a limited set of subclasses that can extend a particular class or implement an interface. By declaring a class or interface as sealed, you explicitly specify the permitted subclasses. This provides stronger encapsulation and better maintainability by ensuring that the set of subclasses remains controlled and predictable.

## Updating sealed classes in Java 22

With the introduction of pattern matching in Java 22, working with sealed classes becomes even more convenient. Pattern matching simplifies the code needed to handle multiple subclasses of a sealed class, making it easier to perform common operations based on the type of the sealed object.

In earlier versions of Java, handling different subclasses of a sealed class required the use of instanceof checks and explicit type casts. This approach could lead to verbose and error-prone code. However, with pattern matching, the code becomes more concise and readable.

Here's an example to illustrate the updated pattern matching syntax for sealed classes in Java 22:

```java
sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {
    // common methods
}

final class Circle implements Shape {
    // Circle-specific implementation
}

final class Rectangle implements Shape {
    // Rectangle-specific implementation
}
```

Before Java 22, working with different subclasses of `Shape` would involve using instanceof checks and explicit casting. Here's how the code might have looked in earlier versions of Java:

```java
if (shape instanceof Circle) {
    Circle circle = (Circle) shape;
    // handle Circle-specific operations
} else if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
    Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle) shape;
    // handle Rectangle-specific operations
} else {
    // handle other subclasses of Shape
}
```

Now, with pattern matching in Java 22, you can achieve the same result in a more concise way:

```java
if (shape instanceof Circle circle) {
    // handle Circle-specific operations
} else if (shape instanceof Rectangle rectangle) {
    // handle Rectangle-specific operations
} else {
    // handle other subclasses of Shape
}
```

The new syntax automatically introduces a new variable (`circle` and `rectangle` in this case) of the appropriate type and assigns the casted object to it. This eliminates the need for an explicit cast and makes the code more readable.

## Benefits of pattern matching for sealed classes

Pattern matching brings several benefits when working with sealed classes:

- **Concise and readable code**: Pattern matching simplifies the code required to handle different subclasses of a sealed class, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

- **Eliminates explicit type casting**: Pattern matching automatically casts the sealed object to the appropriate subclass, eliminating the need for explicit type casts.

- **Enhanced type safety**: The compiler can perform additional type checks to ensure that the code is handling all possible subclasses of the sealed class, improving type safety.

- **Easy to extend**: Adding new subclasses to a sealed class becomes straightforward, as the code can easily handle the new subclasses by adding a new branch to the pattern matching code block.

## Conclusion

Pattern matching for sealed classes in Java 22 enhances the way we work with sealed classes, making the code more concise, readable, and type-safe. With pattern matching, handling different subclasses becomes simpler, eliminating the need for explicit type casts and reducing boilerplate code. This new feature provides a powerful tool for developers working with sealed classes, improving the overall maintainability and robustness of their code.
