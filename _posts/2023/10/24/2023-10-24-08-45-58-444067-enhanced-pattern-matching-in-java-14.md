Java 14 introduces a new feature called enhanced pattern matching, which enhances the capabilities of pattern matching in Java. Pattern matching, introduced in Java 13, allows developers to simplify the code when dealing with objects of specific types. With the enhancements in Java 14, it becomes even more powerful and easier to use.

## 1. Simplified type checks

One of the primary enhancements in Java 14's pattern matching is the ability to simplify type checks. Previously, when performing type checks on objects, it required explicit casts and instanceof checks. With enhanced pattern matching, developers can now perform type checks directly in the pattern matching syntax.

Consider the following example:

```java
if (obj instanceof String) {
    String str = (String) obj;
    // Use the string value
}
```

With enhanced pattern matching, the above code can be simplified to:

```java
if (obj instanceof String str) {
    // Use the string value directly
}
```

This syntax assigns the object to a variable (`str`) if it is an instance of `String`, allowing you to directly use it in the subsequent code block.

## 2. Conditional pattern matching

Another significant enhancement in Java 14's pattern matching is the introduction of conditional patterns. Conditional patterns allow developers to specify additional conditions when matching patterns, making the pattern matching more flexible and expressive.

Consider the following example:

```java
if (obj instanceof String str && str.length() > 5) {
    // Use the string value only if it has a length greater than 5
}
```

In the above code, the pattern `obj instanceof String str` matches when `obj` is an instance of `String`, and the length of the string is greater than 5. This enables you to filter objects based on specific conditions before using them in the subsequent code block.

## Conclusion

Enhanced pattern matching in Java 14 simplifies type checks and introduces conditional patterns, making pattern matching more powerful and expressive. These enhancements reduce boilerplate code and make the code more readable. By leveraging enhanced pattern matching, developers can write cleaner and more concise Java code.
