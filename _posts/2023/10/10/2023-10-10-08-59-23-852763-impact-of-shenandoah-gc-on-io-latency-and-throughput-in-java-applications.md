Gone are the days when garbage collection (GC) pauses in Java applications were an unavoidable performance bottleneck. With the introduction of Shenandoah GC, Java developers now have a low-pause, concurrent garbage collector that significantly reduces the impact of GC on I/O latency and throughput.

## What is Shenandoah GC?

Shenandoah GC is a state-of-the-art garbage collector that aims to overcome the limitations of traditional GC algorithms, such as Serial GC, Parallel GC, and CMS GC. It is designed to minimize GC pauses by performing concurrent garbage collection in parallel with the application threads. This concurrent approach allows applications to run smoothly without significant interruptions or stalls.

## Reducing I/O Latency

In Java applications, I/O operations can be a critical component that directly affects overall performance. In traditional GC algorithms, stop-the-world pauses can cause I/O operations to stall, leading to increased latency. This can be detrimental in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time systems or applications that handle high-volume network traffic.

Shenandoah GC tackles this problem by minimizing stop-the-world pauses. By performing garbage collection concurrently with application threads, it reduces the overall pause time and ensures that I/O operations can continue uninterrupted. This, in turn, reduces the I/O latency, resulting in improved application responsiveness and better user experience.

## Improving Throughput

Throughput is another crucial performance metric for Java applications, especially in scenarios where high transaction rates or large data processing are involved. Traditional GC algorithms, with their stop-the-world pauses, can significantly impact application throughput, as the CPU resources are diverted to garbage collection instead of executing application logic.

Shenandoah GC addresses this issue by executing the garbage collection concurrently with the application threads. By doing so, it allows the application to utilize the maximum available CPU resources, leading to improved throughput. Applications that heavily rely on CPU-intensive tasks can benefit greatly from the reduced pause times offered by Shenandoah GC.

## Conclusion

Shenandoah GC has introduced a groundbreaking approach to garbage collection in Java applications. By minimizing stop-the-world pauses and executing concurrent garbage collection, it significantly reduces the impact of GC on both I/O latency and application throughput. This makes it an excellent choice for latency-sensitive applications and those that require high throughput.

When working with Java applications, consider leveraging Shenandoah GC to achieve the optimal balance between performance and garbage collection. With its low-pause, concurrent nature, Shenandoah GC opens up new possibilities for building high-performance Java applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.
