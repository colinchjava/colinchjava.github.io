Shenandoah is an advanced garbage collector (GC) algorithm designed for low-latency applications. One of its key features is the concurrent collection set processing, which allows simultaneous garbage collection and mutator threads. In this article, we will explore how concurrent collection set processing works in Shenandoah GC.

## What is a Collection Set?

A collection set is a subset of the heap that contains objects that need to be garbage collected. During the initial mark phase of garbage collection, the GC scans the entire heap to identify live objects and marks them. The collection set is then populated with these marked objects.

## Concurrent Collection Set Processing

Concurrent collection set processing is the process of scanning the collection set concurrently with the running application's mutator threads. This approach ensures that garbage collection does not pause the application for long periods, resulting in low-latency performance.

In Shenandoah GC, the concurrent collection set processing is performed in the following steps:

1. **Initial Mark**: The GC scans the heap and marks live objects. This phase is performed concurrently with the application's mutator threads, ensuring minimal pause time.

2. **Transition Mark**: After the initial mark, the collection set is populated with the marked objects. Concurrently with the mutator threads, the GC continues to mark objects that transitively reference the objects in the collection set. This process is known as the transition mark.

3. **Remark**: Once the transition mark is completed, the GC performs a final remark. This involves revisiting objects that have been modified during the transition mark phase. The remark ensures that all live objects are properly marked before the sweep phase.

4. **Sweep**: Finally, the GC sweeps the collection set, freeing up memory by reclaiming memory blocks occupied by garbage objects.

## Benefits of Concurrent Collection Set Processing

Concurrent collection set processing in Shenandoah GC offers several benefits:

- **Low Latency**: By performing garbage collection concurrently with the application's mutator threads, Shenandoah GC minimizes pause time and provides a low-latency experience.

- **Efficient Memory Reclamation**: The concurrent collection set processing approach ensures effective memory reclamation by scanning the collection set concurrently with the running application.

- **High Throughput**: Shenandoah GC is designed to provide high throughput while maintaining low latency. The concurrent collection set processing plays a crucial role in achieving this goal.

## Conclusion

Concurrent collection set processing is a key feature of the Shenandoah GC algorithm, allowing garbage collection to be performed concurrently with the application's mutator threads. This approach significantly reduces pause time and enables low-latency performance. With efficient memory reclamation and high throughput, Shenandoah GC is well-suited for latency-sensitive applications.

# Concurrent Mark Bitmap in Shenandoah GC

The concurrent mark bitmap is an integral component of Shenandoah GC, an advanced garbage collector algorithm. In this article, we will explore the role and benefits of the concurrent mark bitmap in Shenandoah GC.

## What is the Concurrent Mark Bitmap?

The concurrent mark bitmap is a data structure used by Shenandoah GC to track the liveness of objects during the garbage collection process. It provides a fast and efficient way to mark the live objects and identify the garbage objects.

## How does the Concurrent Mark Bitmap Work?

During the mark phase of garbage collection, the concurrent mark bitmap is used to record the liveness information of objects. It is divided into multiple memory regions, each representing a portion of the heap. The concurrent mark bitmap is updated concurrently with the mutator threads, allowing the garbage collection process to proceed without major pauses.

The concurrent mark bitmap works in the following steps:

1. **Initial Mark**: The GC performs an initial mark by scanning the object graph and marking live objects. The concurrent mark bitmap is updated during this phase.

2. **Concurrent Marking**: The GC continues marking objects concurrently with the mutator threads, using the concurrent mark bitmap to track liveness information. This concurrent marking ensures low-latency performance.

3. **Final Remark**: After the concurrent marking phase, a final remark is performed to revisit objects that may have been modified during the concurrent marking phase. This ensures accurate marking of live objects and prepares for the sweep phase.

4. **Sweep**: During the sweep phase, the concurrent mark bitmap is used to identify the garbage objects that can be safely reclaimed. The memory occupied by these objects is then freed.

## Benefits of Concurrent Mark Bitmap

The concurrent mark bitmap in Shenandoah GC offers several benefits:

- **Low Latency**: By allowing concurrent marking of live objects, the concurrent mark bitmap reduces pause times during garbage collection, resulting in low-latency performance.

- **Scalability**: The concurrent mark bitmap is designed to scale with the size of the heap, ensuring efficient garbage collection for large applications.

- **Memory Efficiency**: The concurrent mark bitmap provides a memory-efficient way to track liveness information without incurring significant overhead.

## Conclusion

The concurrent mark bitmap is a critical component of the Shenandoah GC algorithm. By allowing concurrent marking of live objects during garbage collection, it ensures low latency and high scalability. With its memory-efficient design, Shenandoah GC provides efficient garbage collection for latency-sensitive applications.
