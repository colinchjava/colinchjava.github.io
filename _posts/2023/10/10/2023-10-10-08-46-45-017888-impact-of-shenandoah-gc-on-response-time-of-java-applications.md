In Java applications, garbage collection (GC) plays a crucial role in managing memory and reclaiming unused objects. Traditionally, the default garbage collector, known as the Parallel GC, may introduce noticeable pauses, affecting the response time and performance of the application. 

To address this issue, the Shenandoah GC was introduced as an experimental garbage collector in Java 8 and made production-ready in Java 15. Shenandoah GC focuses on minimizing pause times and maintaining consistent throughput, making it a preferred choice for latency-sensitive applications.

## Reduced Pause Times

The most significant advantage of using Shenandoah GC is the reduced pause times compared to the Parallel GC. With Shenandoah, pause times are significantly shorter and more predictable, ensuring that your application remains responsive even under heavy load.

Shenandoah achieves this by performing garbage collection concurrently with the application's execution. Instead of stopping the application threads entirely, it employs techniques like concurrent marking and evacuation, allowing the Java application to continue running in parallel with the garbage collection process.

## Response Time Improvement

Due to the reduced pause times, the response time of Java applications can be dramatically improved with Shenandoah GC. Applications that heavily rely on low-latency requirements, such as real-time systems, financial applications, or online gaming, can greatly benefit from the use of Shenandoah.

The reduction in pause times helps to maintain a consistent response time, providing a smoother user experience and preventing potential disruptions caused by long GC pauses. With Shenandoah, the response time of your Java application can become more stable and predictable.

## Enabling Shenandoah GC

To enable Shenandoah GC in your Java application, you need to use a compatible JDK version (Java 15 or later) and launch the JVM with the appropriate command-line options. 

For instance, to enable Shenandoah GC, you can use the following command-line flag:

```java
java -XX:+UseShenandoahGC -jar YourApplication.jar
```

This flag instructs the JVM to use Shenandoah GC as the garbage collector for your Java application. 

## Conclusion

The introduction of Shenandoah GC in Java has significantly improved the response time and latency characteristics of Java applications. By reducing the pause times associated with garbage collection, Shenandoah ensures that your application remains responsive even under heavy load. Its concurrent nature allows the garbage collection process to run alongside the application's execution, resulting in a more stable and predictable response time.

Consider enabling Shenandoah GC in your Java application if you are targeting low-latency requirements or if you want to minimize the impact of garbage collection pauses on your application's response time. With Shenandoah GC, you can achieve better performance and deliver a smoother user experience.
