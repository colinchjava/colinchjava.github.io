Java applications typically rely on a garbage collector (GC) to manage memory and reclaim unused objects. The choice of GC algorithm can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the application. Shenandoah GC, introduced in JDK 12, is a low-pause time garbage collector designed specifically to minimize pauses and improve overall application throughput.

In addition to improving garbage collection pauses, Shenandoah GC also has a positive impact on the CPU cache behavior of Java applications. The CPU cache is a small, fast memory that stores frequently accessed data to reduce the latency of accessing data from main memory. Optimizing cache behavior can greatly enhance the performance of an application.

## Understanding CPU Cache Behavior

Before delving into the impact of Shenandoah GC on CPU cache behavior, it's important to understand how the CPU cache works.

Modern CPUs have multiple levels of cache memory, typically L1, L2, and L3 caches. The cache hierarchy is organized in such a way that lower-level caches are smaller and faster, while higher-level caches are larger but slower. The CPU tries to keep as much frequently accessed data as possible in the cache to reduce the number of expensive memory accesses.

When a Java application runs, it loads data from main memory into the cache. The CPU fetches data in cache-sized blocks, called cache lines. When data is accessed, the entire cache line is loaded into the cache, even if only a small portion of it is needed. This is known as cache line granularity.

## Impact of Shenandoah GC on CPU Cache Behavior

Shenandoah GC has been designed with cache behavior in mind to minimize cache pollution and improve overall application performance.

One of the key techniques used by Shenandoah GC is called forward barriers. When an object is moved during garbage collection, a forwarding pointer is placed at the original memory location of the object. Any reference to the original object is updated to point to the new memory location using this forwarding pointer. This technique allows the CPU cache to be aware of object movements and update its cache accordingly.

By dynamically updating references to newly allocated memory, Shenandoah GC reduces the chance of cache misses caused by stale references. This can significantly improve cache hit rates and overall CPU cache utilization, resulting in better performance for Java applications.

## Benchmarking CPU Cache Behavior with Shenandoah GC

To demonstrate the impact of Shenandoah GC on CPU cache behavior, let's consider a benchmark that simulates a multi-threaded Java application running concurrently.

We'll compare the cache behavior when using Shenandoah GC versus the default GC algorithm (such as G1 GC). We'll measure cache hits, misses, and utilization rates using appropriate tools and profiling techniques.

The benchmark results will highlight the improvements in cache behavior achieved by Shenandoah GC, showing how it minimizes cache pollution and optimizes cache utilization in Java applications.

## Conclusion

The choice of GC algorithm can have a profound impact on the performance of Java applications. Shenandoah GC, with its low-pause time characteristics, not only improves garbage collection pauses but also enhances CPU cache behavior.

By using techniques like forward barriers, Shenandoah GC reduces cache pollution and increases cache hit rates, resulting in better overall application performance. Benchmarking and profiling can provide valuable insights into the specific improvements achieved by Shenandoah GC in different scenarios.

As Java applications continue to evolve and require higher performance, considering the impact of GC algorithms like Shenandoah GC on CPU cache behavior becomes crucial for achieving optimal performance.
