Java's garbage collection (GC) process is essential for maintaining memory management and preventing memory leaks. Traditionally, GC algorithms like Concurrent Mark and Sweep (CMS) or Garbage-First (G1) have imposed limitations on thread scheduling and context switching, leading to potential performance bottlenecks. However, with the introduction of Shenandoah GC, these limitations have been significantly reduced, resulting in improved overall performance. In this blog post, we will explore the impact of Shenandoah GC on thread scheduling and context switching in Java.

## What is Shenandoah GC?

Shenandoah GC is a low-pause-time garbage collector introduced in Java 12. It aims to minimize GC pause times and maintain consistent application performance even with very large heaps. Unlike CMS or G1, Shenandoah GC operates concurrently with application threads, meaning that the GC process can run in parallel with your application's execution.

## Thread Scheduling with Shenandoah GC

Traditional GC algorithms, such as CMS, pause the application threads during the garbage collection process. This pause time is directly proportional to the size of the heap and can be a significant hindrance to smooth application performance. Shenandoah GC, on the other hand, significantly reduces the pause time by performing concurrent GC, allowing the application to continue running while garbage collection is underway.

This concurrent nature of Shenandoah GC means that the GC threads and application threads can coexist and execute simultaneously. This improved thread scheduling results in reduced thread contention and improved overall performance.

## Context Switching with Shenandoah GC

Context switching, the process of saving the current state of a thread and restoring the state of another thread, is an expensive operation. Traditional GC algorithms often require frequent context switching between application threads and GC threads, leading to increased overhead and degraded performance.

Shenandoah GC minimizes the need for context switching by performing GC concurrently. The GC threads work in parallel with application threads, reducing the frequency of context switching. This reduction in context switching overhead contributes to improved overall performance and responsiveness of the Java application.

## Conclusion

Shenandoah GC brings significant improvements to thread scheduling and context switching in Java applications. By performing concurrent garbage collection, Shenandoah GC minimizes pause times and allows application threads to execute concurrently. This results in reduced thread contention, improved overall performance, and decreased context switching overhead.

As Java continues to evolve, it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest GC algorithms and their impact on application performance. Shenandoah GC is a notable advancement in the Java ecosystem, providing developers with more flexible and efficient garbage collection options. With its reduced pause times and improved thread scheduling and context switching, Shenandoah GC is worth considering for Java applications that require low-latency and high-performance operations.
