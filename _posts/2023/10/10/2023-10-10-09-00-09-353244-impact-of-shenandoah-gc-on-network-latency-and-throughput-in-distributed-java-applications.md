## Introduction

As distributed systems continue to evolve, the performance of Java applications in these environments becomes increasingly crucial. One major factor that affects the overall performance of distributed Java applications is garbage collection (GC). Traditional GC algorithms like Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) and G1 GC can significantly impact network latency and throughput. However, the introduction of Shenandoah GC brings new possibilities for reducing these performance bottlenecks. This article explores the impact of Shenandoah GC on network latency and throughput in distributed Java applications.

## What is Shenandoah GC?

Shenandoah GC is a low-pause-time garbage collector for Java that is designed to minimize the impact of GC pauses on overall application performance. It is an advanced concurrent GC algorithm introduced in OpenJDK 12 and later versions. Shenandoah GC employs unique techniques to minimize pause times by performing garbage collection concurrently with the application threads.

## Benefits of Shenandoah GC

Shenandoah GC offers several benefits that make it particularly suitable for distributed Java applications:

1. **Low Pause Times**: Shenandoah GC aims to keep GC pause times short and predictable, even as heap sizes grow. This is especially important in distributed systems, where longer pauses can disrupt network operations and cause latency spikes.

2. **High Throughput**: By performing garbage collection concurrently with the application, Shenandoah GC minimizes stop-the-world pauses, allowing the system to maintain a high throughput. This is critical for distributed applications that need to process a large volume of data in a timely manner.

3. **Scalability**: Shenandoah GC is designed to scale with multi-threaded applications running on systems with a large number of CPUs. This scalability allows distributed Java applications to leverage multiple cores efficiently, improving overall performance.

## Impact on Network Latency

In distributed systems, network latency can directly affect the response time of applications. Traditional GC algorithms like CMS and G1 GC can introduce significant pauses, causing network latency spikes. Shenandoah GC, on the other hand, aims to minimize pauses by performing garbage collection concurrently. This leads to more predictable and lower pause times, reducing the impact on network latency. As a result, distributed Java applications leveraging Shenandoah GC can achieve lower and more consistent network latency, leading to improved application responsiveness.

## Impact on Throughput

Throughput is another key performance metric for distributed Java applications. Traditional GC algorithms can cause frequent stop-the-world pauses, halting application threads and reducing overall throughput. Shenandoah GC, with its concurrent garbage collection approach, significantly reduces these pauses. By collecting garbage concurrently with the application, it allows the system to consistently maintain high throughput, even under heavy workloads. This enables distributed Java applications to process data efficiently and meet the demands of high-throughput environments.

## Conclusion

Shenandoah GC offers a significant advantage in minimizing network latency and improving throughput in distributed Java applications. By reducing GC pause times through concurrent garbage collection, Shenandoah GC enables these applications to achieve lower and more predictable network latency, as well as maintain high throughput even under heavy workloads. Utilizing Shenandoah GC can help enhance the performance and responsiveness of distributed Java applications in today's distributed systems.
