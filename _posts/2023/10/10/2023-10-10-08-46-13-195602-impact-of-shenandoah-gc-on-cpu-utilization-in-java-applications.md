Java applications are known for their versatility and cross-platform compatibility. However, one common challenge for Java developers is managing the garbage collection (GC) process, which can have a significant impact on CPU utilization.

In recent years, a new garbage collector called Shenandoah has emerged as a promising solution to this problem. Shenandoah is designed to minimize GC pause times and reduce the impact on application throughput. In this blog post, we will explore the impact of Shenandoah GC on CPU utilization in Java applications.

## Understanding Shenandoah GC
Shenandoah GC is a low-pause garbage collector introduced in Java 11. It aims to reduce the time taken for GC pauses by doing concurrent collection, meaning it can execute GC tasks concurrently with the running application threads, minimizing disruptions to the application's execution.

## Reduced GC Pause Times
One of the significant benefits of Shenandoah GC is the reduction in GC pause times. Traditional garbage collectors like the G1 collector can sometimes cause noticeable pauses, especially in applications with large heaps. These pauses can negatively affect application performance and user experience.

Shenandoah GC uses advanced algorithms and techniques to perform concurrent garbage collection, ensuring that short and consistent pause times are maintained even under heavy load. By minimizing the pause times, it improves the overall responsiveness of the application.

## Impact on CPU Utilization
Reducing GC pause times has a direct impact on CPU utilization. During a typical GC cycle, the CPU is heavily utilized as it performs various GC-related tasks such as marking live objects, relocating objects, and updating object references.

With Shenandoah GC, the concurrent execution of GC tasks ensures that the CPU is efficiently utilized throughout the garbage collection process. By distributing the workload across multiple cores, the CPU utilization is optimized, allowing the application threads to continue their execution uninterrupted.

## Scalability and Throughput
Another advantage of Shenandoah GC is its scalability and throughput. Traditional garbage collectors often struggle to maintain consistent performance in applications with large heaps or high object allocation rates. This can result in increased CPU utilization and decreased throughput.

Shenandoah GC employs parallel and concurrent algorithms to keep up with the demands of modern applications. It efficiently handles large heaps and high object allocation rates, thereby reducing CPU utilization and improving the overall throughput of the application.

## Conclusion
Shenandoah GC offers significant benefits to Java applications, particularly in terms of reducing GC pause times and optimizing CPU utilization. By employing concurrent garbage collection algorithms and techniques, it minimizes disruptions to application execution and ensures consistent performance even under heavy load.

With its scalability and throughput improvements, Shenandoah GC allows Java applications to handle large heaps and high object allocation rates efficiently. By reducing CPU utilization, it enhances application performance and responsiveness.

If you're experiencing high CPU utilization due to GC pauses in your Java applications, consider using Shenandoah GC to alleviate the issue and improve the overall efficiency of your application.
