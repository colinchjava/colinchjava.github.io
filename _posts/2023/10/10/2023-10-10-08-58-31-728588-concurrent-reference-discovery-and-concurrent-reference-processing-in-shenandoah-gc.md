In the world of garbage collection, one of the main challenges is handling references between objects efficiently. Traditional garbage collectors often use a stop-the-world approach, which halts the running application to perform reference discovery and processing. This can result in noticeable pauses for larger applications with heavy object allocation.

Shenandoah GC, developed by Red Hat, aims to minimize these pauses by implementing concurrent reference discovery and concurrent reference processing. In this blog post, we will explore how these two features work together to improve garbage collection efficiency in Shenandoah GC.

## Concurrent Reference Discovery

Reference discovery is the process of identifying references between objects in memory. In traditional garbage collectors, this process is typically performed during the stop-the-world pauses. However, Shenandoah GC takes a different approach by performing reference discovery concurrently with the application's execution.

To achieve concurrent reference discovery, Shenandoah GC tracks object allocations and updates reference information in real-time. It scans objects in memory as they are created or modified, identifying references and storing them in a reference table. This allows the reference discovery process to occur simultaneously with the application's execution, significantly reducing pause times.

## Concurrent Reference Processing

Reference processing involves iterating through the reference table and performing necessary operations on each reference. This can include updating reference counters, marking referenced objects, or performing other garbage collection-related tasks.

With concurrent reference processing, Shenandoah GC takes advantage of multiple threads to iterate through the reference table concurrently with the application's execution. This allows for faster processing, as multiple threads can work in parallel to perform reference operations.

By combining concurrent reference discovery and concurrent reference processing, Shenandoah GC is able to significantly reduce the pauses caused by garbage collection. This is particularly beneficial for large applications or applications with high object allocation rates, as it minimizes the impact on overall application performance.

## Conclusion

Concurrent reference discovery and concurrent reference processing are two key features of Shenandoah GC that help improve garbage collection efficiency. By performing these tasks concurrently with the application's execution, Shenandoah GC minimizes stop-the-world pauses and provides more consistent performance for applications.

If you're interested in optimizing garbage collection performance or have large-scale applications with heavy object allocation, Shenandoah GC may be worth exploring. Its concurrent approach to reference discovery and processing can help keep your application running smoothly while efficiently managing memory.
