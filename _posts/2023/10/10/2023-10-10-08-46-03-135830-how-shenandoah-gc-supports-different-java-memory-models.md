Java is a versatile programming language that supports different memory models to cater to a wide range of application requirements. One of the popular memory models in Java is the Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector. However, in recent years, a new garbage collector called Shenandoah GC has gained traction due to its ability to handle large heaps with low pause times. In this blog post, we will explore how Shenandoah GC supports different Java memory models, making it a powerful choice for applications with varying memory needs.

## What is Shenandoah GC?

Shenandoah GC is a garbage collector introduced in OpenJDK version 12. It aims to minimize the impact of garbage collection pauses on Java applications by performing garbage collection concurrently with the execution of the application. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require low pause times and high throughput.

## Support for Different Memory Models

Shenandoah GC provides flexibility in supporting different memory models in Java. Here are some key ways in which Shenandoah GC supports various memory models:

### 1. Generational Memory Model Support

The generational memory model is a common memory model used in Java applications. It divides the heap into young and old generations, with most objects being created in the young generation. Shenandoah GC supports this memory model efficiently by performing concurrent garbage collection on the old generation while concurrently evacuating objects from the young generation.

### 2. Large Heap Support

Some applications require large heap sizes to handle massive amounts of data. Shenandoah GC excels in supporting large heaps by implementing a concurrent compaction algorithm. This algorithm allows Shenandoah GC to defragment the heap while the application is running, ensuring efficient memory usage and minimizing pause times.

### 3. Concurrent Marking and Relocation

Shenandoah GC employs a concurrent marking algorithm that operates concurrently with the application's execution. This algorithm efficiently identifies live and dead objects without causing significant pauses. Additionally, Shenandoah GC employs concurrent object relocation techniques, which ensure that objects can be moved within the heap during garbage collection without interrupting the application's execution.

### 4. Reference Processing

Java applications heavily rely on references to manage memory. Shenandoah GC supports concurrent reference processing, ensuring that references are processed without impacting application performance. This capability results in efficient memory management and reduced pause times.

By supporting these different memory models, Shenandoah GC provides Java developers with the flexibility to tune the garbage collector based on their application's specific requirements.

## Conclusion

Shenandoah GC is a powerful garbage collector that supports different Java memory models. Whether it's handling large heaps, supporting generational memory models, or concurrently processing references, Shenandoah GC excels in optimizing the garbage collection process while minimizing pause times. With its ability to balance throughput and low-latency requirements, Shenandoah GC is an excellent choice for Java applications with diverse memory needs.
