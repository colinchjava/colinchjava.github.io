## Introduction

Garbage collection is an essential aspect of any modern programming language runtime. It ensures that unused memory is freed up, preventing memory leaks and improving overall application performance. However, traditional garbage collection algorithms can introduce significant pauses in system execution, causing noticeable delays.

Shenandoah GC is a garbage collector designed to minimize the impact of system pauses on application performance. It is an open-source garbage collector developed by Red Hat for use in the OpenJDK platform. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of safepoints and how Shenandoah GC tackles the problem of system pauses.

## Safepoints and System Pauses

In Java, safepoints are specific locations in code where the execution can be suspended to perform certain operations, such as garbage collection. At safepoints, all running threads are paused to ensure data consistency during the garbage collection process. However, these pauses can cause interruptions in the execution of time-sensitive applications, resulting in unresponsive user interfaces or degraded performance.

Traditional garbage collectors, such as the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector, have safepoints at which the application threads are stopped to allow for garbage collection. These pauses can be significant, especially for large heaps or applications with stringent response time requirements.

## Shenandoah GC to the Rescue

Shenandoah GC addresses the problem of system pauses by introducing *concurrent evacuation* and *concurrent compacting*. These techniques allow the garbage collector to perform its tasks concurrently with the application threads, reducing the need for long pauses.

### 1. Concurrent Evacuation

Shenandoah GC uses concurrent evacuation to move live objects from one set of memory regions (old regions) to another set of memory regions (new regions) without stopping the application threads. It uses an incremental barrier to track modified objects, ensuring that all live objects are moved to the new regions gradually.

### 2. Concurrent Compacting

In addition to concurrent evacuation, Shenandoah GC also performs concurrent compaction. Traditional collectors require a system pause to compact memory regions and defragment the heap. In contrast, Shenandoah GC compacts memory regions concurrently with the application threads, reducing or eliminating system pauses altogether.

## Advantages of Shenandoah GC

Shenandoah GC offers several advantages over traditional garbage collectors, including:

- **Reduced System Pauses**: By allowing concurrent evacuation and compaction, Shenandoah GC minimizes the impact of garbage collection on system pauses. This leads to improved application responsiveness and reduced latency.

- **Predictable Latency**: Shenandoah GC aims to provide consistent and predictable garbage collection latency, regardless of the heap size or memory utilization. This predictability is crucial for applications with stringent performance requirements.

- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Shenandoah GC optimizes memory usage by compacting memory regions and minimizing fragmentation. This results in better overall memory utilization, leading to increased application performance.

## Conclusion

Shenandoah GC is a remarkable garbage collector that addresses the challenge of system pauses during garbage collection. By introducing concurrent evacuation and compacting, it significantly reduces the impact of garbage collection on application performance. With reduced pauses and predictable latency, Shenandoah GC is a valuable addition to the Java runtime environment, particularly for applications with stringent response time requirements.
