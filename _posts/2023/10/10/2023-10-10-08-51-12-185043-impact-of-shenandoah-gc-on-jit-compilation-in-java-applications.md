Garbage collection is a vital aspect of Java applications as it helps manage memory efficiently. Traditionally, the use of garbage collectors comes with a tradeoff between throughput and pause times. However, with the introduction of Shenandoah GC, Java developers now have another option that significantly reduces the pause times.

## What is Shenandoah GC?

Shenandoah GC is a low-pause-time garbage collector introduced in JDK 12 as an experimental feature and made production-ready in JDK 15. It employs concurrent evacuation, which means it can collect objects without stopping the application threads for long pauses. This makes it an ideal choice for latency-sensitive applications and systems requiring high responsiveness.

## Impact on JIT compilation

JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation is an optimization technique used by Java virtual machines to improve the performance of applications while they are running. It converts frequently executed parts of the code into machine instructions, making subsequent executions faster.

Shenandoah GC brings significant benefits to JIT compilation in Java applications. Here's how:

### 1. Reduced pause times

One of the main advantages of Shenandoah GC is its ability to minimize pause times during garbage collection. This directly benefits JIT compilation as it allows for uninterrupted execution of the application code. With fewer pauses, the JIT compiler can operate more efficiently, optimizing the code and generating faster machine instructions.

### 2. Better throughput

While minimizing pause times is the primary goal of Shenandoah GC, it also ensures good throughput by executing most of the garbage collection work concurrently with the application threads. This means that JIT compilation is less likely to be affected by garbage collection pauses, leading to improved overall throughput.

### 3. Improved application responsiveness

The reduced pause times provided by Shenandoah GC result in improved application responsiveness. This is crucial for applications that require low latency or real-time capabilities. With faster garbage collection, the JIT compiler can keep up with the demands of the application, ensuring a smoother and more responsive user experience.

## Conclusion

Shenandoah GC has a positive impact on JIT compilation in Java applications. By minimizing pause times, it allows JIT compilers to operate more efficiently and generate faster machine instructions. This results in improved throughput and better application responsiveness overall. If you're working on latency-sensitive or real-time Java applications, considering Shenandoah GC as your garbage collector can bring significant performance benefits.
