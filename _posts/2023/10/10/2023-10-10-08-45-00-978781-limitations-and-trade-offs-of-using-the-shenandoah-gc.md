When it comes to garbage collection (GC) algorithms in Java, the Shenandoah garbage collector is gaining popularity. It is an ultra-low pause time garbage collector designed to reduce the long GC pauses often associated with other collectors. While Shenandoah offers several advantages, it also has its limitations and trade-offs that developers should be aware of before incorporating it into their applications. In this article, we will explore the limitations and trade-offs of using the Shenandoah GC.

## Advantages of Shenandoah GC

Before diving into the limitations, let's briefly discuss some advantages of using the Shenandoah GC:

1. **Ultra-Low Pause Times**: The primary goal of Shenandoah is to minimize pause times in garbage collection. It achieves this by performing concurrent marking, concurrent evacuation, and concurrent compaction, resulting in significantly reduced pauses.

2. **Scalability**: Shenandoah is designed to scale with large heaps and multi-processor systems. It reduces the impact of garbage collection on application throughput, enabling better scalability for highly concurrent and memory-intensive applications.

3. **Compatibility**: Shenandoah is available as part of the OpenJDK project and is compatible with Java SE 8 or later versions, making it easy to adopt in existing Java applications without requiring major changes to application code.

## Limitations

Despite its advantages, Shenandoah has a few limitations to keep in mind:

1. **Increased Memory Overhead**: Shenandoah introduces additional memory overhead to represent object metadata required for concurrent evacuation and compaction. Depending on the application workload and heap size, this overhead can impact overall memory consumption.

2. **Higher CPU Utilization**: Shenandoah utilizes more CPU resources compared to some other garbage collectors. This increased CPU usage is mainly due to concurrent tasks performed during garbage collection, such as concurrent marking and concurrent evacuation.

3. **Reliance on Hardware Support**: Shenandoah relies on certain hardware features, such as load barriers, to achieve its low-pause time goals. While most modern hardware supports these features, older or less common hardware may not be fully compatible.

## Trade-offs

In addition to the limitations mentioned above, using the Shenandoah GC involves some trade-offs:

1. **Throughput Reduction**: While Shenandoah excels in reducing pause times, it may slightly impact application throughput compared to parallel or CMS collectors. The concurrent tasks performed during garbage collection introduce some overhead, which may result in slightly lower application throughput.

2. **Increased Garbage Collection Time**: Although Shenandoah aims to minimize pause times, the overall garbage collection time may increase due to the concurrent nature of the collector. This can be a trade-off when comparing it with other collectors that prioritize overall collection time.

## Conclusion

The Shenandoah garbage collector offers significant benefits by minimizing GC pause times and improving scalability for Java applications. However, it is important to consider the limitations and trade-offs mentioned above when choosing to use Shenandoah. Depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of your application, it may be worth evaluating whether the advantages of Shenandoah outweigh its limitations in your particular use case.
