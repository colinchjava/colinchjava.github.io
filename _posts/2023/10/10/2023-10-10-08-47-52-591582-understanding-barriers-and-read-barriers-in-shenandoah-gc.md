Garbage collection is an important aspect of managing memory in programming languages. It helps reclaim unused memory by identifying and freeing resources that are no longer needed. Shenandoah is a garbage collector designed for low-pause time and high-throughput applications. In this article, we will explore the concepts of barriers and read barriers in Shenandoah GC.

## Barriers in Shenandoah GC

In a garbage collector, barriers are used to identify and track changes to objects during the execution of the program. Shenandoah GC employs barriers to ensure that all changes made to objects are properly accounted for during the garbage collection process. There are two types of barriers used in Shenandoah GC: write barriers and read barriers.

### Write Barriers

Write barriers in Shenandoah GC are used to track modifications made to objects. Whenever a write operation is performed on an object, the barrier intercepts the write and performs additional bookkeeping to keep track of the change. This allows the garbage collector to identify objects that have been modified and mark them for inclusion in the next garbage collection cycle.

### Read Barriers

Unlike write barriers, read barriers are optional in Shenandoah GC. They are used to handle read operations on objects that are concurrently being modified during garbage collection. When a read operation is performed on an object, a read barrier ensures that the latest version of the object is accessed. This is important to maintain data consistency and avoid potential issues that may arise from accessing outdated object versions.

## Benefits of Barriers in Shenandoah GC

The use of barriers in Shenandoah GC offers several benefits:

1. **Efficient garbage collection**: Barriers help improve the efficiency of garbage collection by allowing the garbage collector to track object modifications accurately.

2. **Low-pause time**: By accurately tracking modifications and minimizing the need to stop the execution of the program, Shenandoah GC achieves low-pause time, making it suitable for applications with stringent latency requirements.

3. **Thread concurrency**: The use of read barriers in Shenandoah GC allows concurrent modification and read access to objects, ensuring that the program continues to execute smoothly with minimal interruptions.

## Conclusion

Barriers play a crucial role in the operation of Shenandoah GC by tracking changes to objects and ensuring the efficient execution of garbage collection. Write barriers track modifications, while read barriers handle concurrent access to objects. By utilizing these barriers, Shenandoah GC achieves low-pause time, high throughput, and efficient memory management in modern applications.
