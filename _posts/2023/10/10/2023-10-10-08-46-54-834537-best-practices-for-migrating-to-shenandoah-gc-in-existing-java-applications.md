The Shenandoah garbage collector (GC) is a low-latency garbage collector designed for Java applications with large heaps. It aims to reduce pause times and maximize throughput, making it a popular choice for applications that require high performance and responsiveness. 

If you're considering migrating your existing Java application to use Shenandoah GC, here are some best practices to follow:

## 1. Understand Your Application's Memory Behavior

Before migrating to Shenandoah GC, it's important to understand your application's memory behavior. Monitor your application's memory usage and garbage collection patterns using tools like Java Flight Recorder or Garbage Collection logs. This will give you insights into the current GC algorithms being used and their impact on your application's performance.

## 2. Assess Compatibility and Requirements

Ensure that your Java version is compatible with Shenandoah GC. As of Java 12, Shenandoah is an experimental feature and needs to be enabled explicitly. From Java 14 onwards, Shenandoah is no longer considered experimental but may still require manual activation.

Consider the specific requirements and guarantees of your application. Shenandoah GC may provide low pause times, but it does come with certain trade-offs, such as increased memory overhead. Evaluate whether the benefits outweigh these trade-offs for your specific use case.

## 3. Optimize Heap and Garbage Collection Settings

Review and optimize your application's heap and garbage collection settings to make the most of Shenandoah GC. Adjust the heap size and garbage collection parameters based on your application's memory requirements and usage patterns. Fine-tuning these settings can help maximize the performance benefits of Shenandoah.

## 4. Conduct Thorough Testing

Perform extensive testing before deploying your application with Shenandoah GC in production. Use load testing tools to simulate real-world scenarios and measure the impact on latency, throughput, and memory usage. This will help identify any potential issues or bottlenecks, allowing you to fine-tune your configuration and assess the overall benefits of using Shenandoah GC.

## 5. Monitor and Tune as Needed

Once you have migrated your application to Shenandoah GC, it's important to continuously monitor its performance and make adjustments as needed. Monitor key metrics such as pause times, throughput, and memory usage. Use monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana to gain insights into your application's behavior and make informed decisions for further optimization.

## Conclusion

Migrating to Shenandoah GC can be a beneficial move for Java applications that require low-latency garbage collection. By following these best practices, you can ensure a smooth and successful migration, while maximizing the performance benefits of Shenandoah GC.
