In the world of Java garbage collection, minimizing latency and ensuring consistent application performance are critical. Traditional garbage collection algorithms often introduce pauses, commonly known as stop-the-world pauses, which can disrupt the smooth execution of latency-sensitive applications.

Introducing Shenandoah GC, a low-latency garbage collector specifically designed to address these concerns. In this article, we'll explore how Shenandoah GC reduces pause times and improves the performance of latency-sensitive Java applications.

## What is Shenandoah GC?

Shenandoah GC is a garbage collection algorithm introduced in the HotSpot JVM by Red Hat. It is designed to minimize pause times and achieve low-latency garbage collection for Java applications.

## Low pause times

One of the key features of Shenandoah GC is its ability to perform garbage collection concurrently with the execution of the application. This means that it can reclaim memory without introducing significant pause times, allowing latency-sensitive applications to remain responsive and performant.

Traditional garbage collection algorithms often require stop-the-world pauses, where the application's execution is temporarily halted to perform garbage collection. These pauses can last for several milliseconds or even seconds, depending on the size of the heap and the amount of live objects. In contrast, Shenandoah GC aims to keep pause times within tens of milliseconds, making it suitable for applications that require low latency.

## Pauseless garbage collection

Shenandoah GC achieves low pause times by employing a technique called concurrent mark and concurrent evacuation. During the concurrent mark phase, the algorithm tracks the live objects in the heap while allowing the application to continue executing. This concurrent marking process significantly reduces the time spent in the subsequent evacuation phase, where the garbage collector moves objects from one part of the heap to another.

By performing garbage collection concurrently, Shenandoah GC avoids lengthy pause times and ensures that latency-sensitive applications can continue running smoothly.

## Impact on Java applications

The impact of Shenandoah GC on latency-sensitive Java applications can be significant. By reducing pause times and minimizing disruptions caused by garbage collection, applications can maintain consistent performance and responsiveness.

Latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time systems, financial trading platforms, and gaming servers, heavily rely on predictable and low-latency execution. With Shenandoah GC, these applications can experience minimal pauses, resulting in smoother user experiences, faster response times, and improved overall performance.

## Conclusion

Shenandoah GC provides a valuable solution for latency-sensitive Java applications by minimizing pause times and introducing concurrent garbage collection. By reducing disruptions caused by garbage collection, applications can deliver consistent performance and responsiveness.

As the demand for low-latency applications continues to grow, Shenandoah GC offers a promising solution for developers looking to optimize their Java applications. By implementing Shenandoah GC, latency-sensitive applications can maximize their potential and provide exceptional user experiences.
