Shenandoah is a garbage collector (GC) designed for low pause time and high throughput in Java applications. One of the key optimizations that Shenandoah implements is heap compaction and object relocation. In this blog post, we will explore how heap compaction works in Shenandoah GC and why object relocation is beneficial for memory management.

## What is Heap Compaction?

Heap compaction is a technique used by garbage collectors to optimize memory utilization and improve performance. It involves rearranging objects in the memory to eliminate fragmentation and create contiguous blocks of free memory.

In the context of Shenandoah GC, heap compaction is performed as part of the garbage collection process. When the GC determines that a sufficient amount of memory is reclaimed, it initiates compaction to optimize the layout of objects in the heap.

During compaction, objects that are still in use are moved to a new location in the heap, while unreachable objects are discarded. This process ensures that the memory is efficiently utilized and reduces the chances of memory fragmentation.

## Object Relocation in Shenandoah GC

Object relocation is an essential step in the heap compaction process of Shenandoah GC. When an object needs to be moved, the GC performs the following steps:

1. The GC identifies the object to be relocated and determines its size.
2. It finds a suitable location in the new compacted area of the heap.
3. The object's fields and references are updated to reflect the new memory location.
4. Finally, the object is copied to its new position, and the old memory location is marked as free.

By relocating objects, Shenandoah GC can ensure that the objects are closer together in memory, reducing the time required to traverse them during garbage collection. This relocation process is performed incrementally, so it has minimal impact on the overall application performance.

## Benefits of Heap Compaction

There are several benefits to heap compaction and object relocation in Shenandoah GC:

1. **Reduced Fragmentation**: Heap compaction eliminates memory fragmentation, which improves memory utilization and reduces the chance of out-of-memory errors.
2. **Improved Cache Performance**: Objects that are closer together in memory improve cache locality, leading to faster memory access and improved overall application performance.
3. **Lower Pause Times**: By performing compaction incrementally, Shenandoah GC avoids long pause times typically associated with full compacting GC algorithms. This enables applications to remain responsive and reduces the impact on user experience.

Overall, heap compaction and object relocation provide significant advantages in terms of memory management, performance, and pause time reduction in Shenandoah GC.

## Conclusion

Heap compaction and object relocation are important techniques used by Shenandoah GC to optimize memory utilization and improve application performance. By eliminating fragmentation and relocating objects, Shenandoah GC achieves low pause times and high throughput, making it an excellent choice for Java applications that require responsive and efficient garbage collection. 

By understanding these techniques, developers can make informed decisions about using Shenandoah GC in their applications and maximize the benefits it provides.
