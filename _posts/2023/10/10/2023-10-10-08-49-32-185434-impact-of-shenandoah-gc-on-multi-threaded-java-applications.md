In recent years, the Java Garbage Collector (GC) landscape has seen significant advancements. One of the notable additions is the Shenandoah GC, introduced in JDK 12 as an experimental feature and made production-ready in JDK 15. This GC algorithm aims to minimize pause times for large heaps, making it particularly advantageous for multi-threaded Java applications. In this blog post, we will explore the impact of Shenandoah GC on such applications and understand how it improves overall performance.

## Understanding Shenandoah GC

Shenandoah GC is a concurrent and compacting garbage collector, designed to achieve ultra-low pause time. Unlike traditional garbage collectors, Shenandoah GC significantly reduces pause times by performing garbage collection concurrently with the running application threads. This concurrent approach allows applications to continue their execution, reducing the impact of long pause times on overall performance.

## Benefits of Shenandoah GC for multi-threaded applications

### 1. Reduced pause times

Shenandoah GC excels in reducing pause times, especially under heavy multi-threaded workloads. By concurrently collecting garbage, it eliminates the need for Stop-The-World pauses, where application threads are halted while garbage collection is performed. This reduction in pause times can lead to smoother application performance, improved responsiveness, and better user experience.

### 2. Improved scalability

For applications with high thread counts, Shenandoah GC demonstrates excellent scalability. The concurrent approach allows it to effectively utilize multiple CPU cores, distributing the garbage collection work across threads. This means that as the number of threads increases, the garbage collection overhead remains relatively low, resulting in better overall application performance.

### 3. More efficient memory management

Shenandoah GC uses a compacting approach, which improves memory utilization by reducing fragmentation. It rearranges memory objects during garbage collection, ensuring that free memory is contiguous, thus minimizing wasted space. This can be particularly beneficial for multi-threaded applications that allocate and deallocate memory frequently, as it reduces memory fragmentation and enhances overall memory management efficiency.

## Considerations and limitations

While Shenandoah GC offers numerous benefits for multi-threaded Java applications, it is essential to consider a few limitations:

- **JDK version compatibility:** Shenandoah GC is available in JDK 12 and later versions. Ensure that your application is compatible with the specific JDK version you're using to take full advantage of this GC algorithm.
- **Increased overhead:** Although Shenandoah GC reduces pause times, it introduces some additional overhead due to concurrent garbage collection processing. It is crucial to monitor and analyze the impact of this overhead on your particular application workload to ensure it aligns with your performance requirements.
- **Elasticity of pause times:** While Shenandoah GC minimizes long pauses, it does not completely eliminate them. In certain scenarios, such as heavy memory allocation or large object processing, longer pauses may still occur. Application profiling and understanding memory patterns can help identify potential bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

Shenandoah GC brings significant performance improvements to multi-threaded Java applications, with reduced pause times, improved scalability, and efficient memory management. By taking advantage of concurrent garbage collection, developers can create highly responsive and efficient applications that can handle heavy workloads without sacrificing user experience. However, it is essential to evaluate compatibility, monitor overhead, and understand the limitations to effectively leverage Shenandoah GC for optimal results.
