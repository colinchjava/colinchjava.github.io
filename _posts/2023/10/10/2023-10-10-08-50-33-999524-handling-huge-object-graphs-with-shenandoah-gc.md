In modern software development, handling large object graphs is becoming increasingly common. These object graphs can pose challenges for garbage collectors, which are responsible for reclaiming memory that is no longer in use. Traditional garbage collection algorithms can struggle with large object graphs, leading to long pauses and inefficient memory usage.

In this blog post, we will explore how the Shenandoah garbage collector (GC) can help handle huge object graphs more effectively.

## What is Shenandoah GC?

Shenandoah GC is a low-pause garbage collector developed by Red Hat for OpenJDK. It is designed to reduce garbage collection pause times, especially on large heap sizes. Shenandoah uses a concurrent algorithm that allows it to work concurrently with the application, minimizing pauses and improving overall throughput.

## Benefits of Shenandoah GC for Huge Object Graphs

### Reduced Pause Times

One of the main benefits of using Shenandoah GC for handling huge object graphs is its ability to reduce pause times. Traditional garbage collectors rely on stop-the-world pauses to scan and mark objects, which can lead to noticeable delays in applications with large object graphs. Shenandoah, on the other hand, performs concurrent marking and concurrent evacuation, allowing it to minimize pause times even for extremely large heaps.

### Efficient Memory Usage

Large object graphs can consume significant amounts of memory, making efficient memory usage crucial. Shenandoah GC employs a region-based memory layout, which helps optimize memory usage for large heaps. It divides the heap into smaller regions, allowing for more efficient garbage collection and minimizing the impact on overall memory usage.

### Scalability

Another important aspect of handling huge object graphs is scalability. Shenandoah GC is designed to scale with increasing heap sizes, making it suitable for applications that deal with massive amounts of data. It can handle heaps in the terabyte range without compromising pause times or overall application performance.

### Good Compatibility

Shenandoah GC is compatible with a wide range of Java applications and frameworks. It works with the HotSpot JVM and supports a variety of platforms and operating systems. This makes it easy to integrate Shenandoah into existing projects without significant modifications or compatibility issues.

## Conclusion

When dealing with huge object graphs, traditional garbage collectors can struggle with long pause times and inefficient memory usage. By utilizing Shenandoah GC, developers can reduce pause times, improve memory usage, and achieve better scalability. With its concurrent marking and evacuation algorithms, Shenandoah makes handling large object graphs a much smoother process.

If you're working on applications that involve large object graphs, give Shenandoah GC a try and experience the benefits it brings to your application's performance.
