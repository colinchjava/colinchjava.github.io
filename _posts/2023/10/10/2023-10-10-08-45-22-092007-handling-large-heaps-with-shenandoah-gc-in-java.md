When working with large heaps in Java applications, garbage collection can become a challenging task. The Shenandoah garbage collector, introduced in JDK 12, aims to address the limitations of traditional garbage collectors for handling large heaps. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Shenandoah garbage collector to optimize the management of large heaps in Java.

## What is Shenandoah GC?

Shenandoah is a low-pause-time garbage collector designed for multi-threaded applications. It focuses on reducing the pause times associated with garbage collection, which can be particularly problematic with large heaps. Shenandoah achieves this by performing garbage collection concurrently with the running Java threads, which significantly reduces the impact of collection pauses on application performance.

## Enabling Shenandoah GC

To enable Shenandoah GC, you need to use a JDK that supports it (JDK 12 or later) and add the following JVM flag when running your Java application:

```java
-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseShenandoahGC
```

By enabling the experimental JVM options and using the `UseShenandoahGC` flag, you instruct the JVM to use Shenandoah as the garbage collector.

## Advantages of Shenandoah GC

Shenandoah GC offers several advantages for handling large heaps:

1. **Low pause times**: Shenandoah's concurrent garbage collection reduces the pause times associated with garbage collection. With Shenandoah, the garbage collector works concurrently with the application threads, resulting in shorter and more predictable pause times.

2. **Large heap support**: Shenandoah is designed to handle large heaps efficiently. It employs various techniques, such as concurrent evacuation and concurrent compaction, to minimize the impact of garbage collection on large heaps.

3. **Compatibility**: Shenandoah is compatible with existing Java libraries and frameworks. You can use it with your existing Java applications without any significant code changes.

## Limitations

While Shenandoah GC offers many benefits for handling large heaps, it also has some limitations to consider:

1. **Performance overhead**: Shenandoah's concurrent nature adds some overhead to the garbage collection process. While this overhead is usually negligible for most applications, it can affect specific workloads that heavily rely on single-threaded performance.

2. **Memory footprint**: Shenandoah requires additional memory to store additional metadata. Although this memory overhead is generally minor, it can be noticeable when dealing with extremely large heaps.

## Conclusion

Shenandoah GC is a valuable addition to Java's arsenal of garbage collectors, specifically designed to handle large heaps with reduced pause times. By enabling Shenandoah GC in your Java application, you can effectively manage and optimize garbage collection for large heap sizes. However, it's essential to consider the trade-offs and limitations associated with Shenandoah when deciding whether to use it in your application.
