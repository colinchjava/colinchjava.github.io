Garbage collection (GC) is an essential component of modern programming languages like Java. It helps manage memory by reclaiming unused objects, preventing memory leaks, and allowing efficient memory allocation. Over the years, several GC algorithms have been developed, each with its own characteristics and trade-offs. In this blog post, we will compare Shenandoah, a low-pause time garbage collector for Java, with other popular GC algorithms.

## 1. Introduction to GC Algorithms

Before diving into the comparison, let's briefly understand some commonly used GC algorithms:

### a. Serial GC
Serial GC, also known as the "stop-the-world" collector, pauses all application threads during garbage collection. It is suitable for small applications or single-threaded environments.

### b. Parallel GC
Parallel GC uses multiple threads to perform garbage collection, reducing the pause times compared to Serial GC. It's optimized for throughput and is well-suited for server applications.

### c. CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep)
CMS is designed to minimize pause times by performing the bulk of garbage collection concurrently while the application is still running. It uses multiple threads for garbage collection, but some pauses are still required for certain operations.

### d. G1 (Garbage First)
G1 is a low-pause time collector that divides the heap into multiple regions. It performs concurrent garbage collection and is designed to reduce pause times while achieving good throughput.

### e. Shenandoah
Shenandoah GC is a highly concurrent garbage collector that aims to drastically reduce pause times even for applications with large heaps. It uses a variety of techniques such as concurrent marking, concurrent evacuation, and load-barrier suppression to achieve its goals.

## 2. Comparison Metrics

To compare Shenandoah GC with other GC algorithms, we will evaluate them based on the following metrics:

- **Pause Time**: The time taken by the GC algorithm to pause application threads during garbage collection.
- **Throughput**: The amount of work done by the GC algorithm in a given time interval.
- **Footprint**: The amount of memory occupied by the GC algorithm itself.
- **Scalability**: The ability of the GC algorithm to efficiently utilize multiple cores.

## 3. Comparison Results

Based on the above metrics, let's compare Shenandoah GC with other GC algorithms:

| Algorithm | Pause Time | Throughput | Footprint | Scalability |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Serial GC | High       | Low        | Low       | Low         |
| Parallel GC  | Moderate  | High       | High       | High       |
| CMS       | Moderate  | Moderate  | Moderate  | Moderate    |
| G1        | Low        | Moderate  | Moderate  | Moderate    |
| Shenandoah  | Low        | High       | Moderate  | High       |

As we can see from the comparison table, Shenandoah GC stands out with its low pause times, high throughput, and scalability. It provides a good balance between pause times and throughput, making it suitable for applications that require low latency and high performance.

## 4. When to Use Shenandoah

While Shenandoah GC offers impressive benefits, it may not be the best choice for every application. Consider using Shenandoah in the following scenarios:

- Applications that require low pause times and low latency.
- Applications with large heaps where pause times of other GC algorithms are unacceptable.
- Applications where high throughput and scalability are essential.
- Multi-threaded or multi-core environments where parallelism is crucial.

## Conclusion

In this comparison, we looked at various GC algorithms in Java, with a specific focus on Shenandoah GC. While other GC algorithms have their merits, Shenandoah stands out for its low pause times, high throughput, and scalability. However, it is essential to evaluate each algorithm's suitability based on the specific requirements of your application.

Remember that GC algorithms continue to evolve and improve over time, so keep an eye on updates and advancements in the Java ecosystem to make informed decisions about GC algorithm choices.
