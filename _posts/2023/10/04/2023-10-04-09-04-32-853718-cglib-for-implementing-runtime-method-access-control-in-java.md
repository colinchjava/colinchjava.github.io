In Java, there are situations where you may want to implement runtime method access control, preventing certain methods from being called based on various conditions. One popular library that helps achieve this is CGLIB.

## What is CGLIB?

CGLIB, which stands for Code Generation Library, is a powerful library in Java that allows you to generate dynamic proxies for classes at runtime. It is commonly used for method interception and method access control.

## How does CGLIB work?

CGLIB works by generating bytecode for a subclass of the target class, which then delegates method calls to the original class. This allows you to intercept and modify method invocations at runtime.

## Implementing Runtime Method Access Control using CGLIB

To implement runtime method access control using CGLIB, you can follow these steps:

1. Add the CGLIB dependency to your project. You can include it in your Maven or Gradle configuration.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>cglib</groupId>
    <artifactId>cglib</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Create a class that extends `MethodInterceptor` from the CGLIB library. This class will intercept method calls and determine whether the method can be invoked or not based on your access control logic.

```java
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodInterceptor;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy;

import java.lang.reflect.Method;
    
public class AccessControlInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {
    private final Object target;
    
    public AccessControlInterceptor(Object target) {
        this.target = target;
    }
    
    @Override
    public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable {
        // Perform your access control logic here
        if (isMethodAllowed(method)) {
            return method.invoke(target, args);
        } else {
            throw new IllegalAccessException("Access denied to method: " + method.getName());
        }
    }
    
    // Implement your access control logic here
    private boolean isMethodAllowed(Method method) {
        // Add your access control logic based on your requirements
        // For example, check if the method is allowed based on user roles
        return true;
    }
}
```

3. Create an instance of the target class and wrap it with the access control interceptor.

```java
AccessControlInterceptor interceptor = new AccessControlInterceptor(new MyTargetClass());
MyTargetClass proxiedTarget = (MyTargetClass) Enhancer.create(MyTargetClass.class, interceptor);
```

4. You can now use `proxiedTarget` to invoke methods on the target class. The interceptor will intercept the method calls and apply your access control logic before delegating the call to the original method.

```java
proxiedTarget.allowedMethod(); // This method will be allowed based on your access control logic
proxiedTarget.deniedMethod(); // This method will throw an IllegalAccessException based on your access control logic
```

## Conclusion

CGLIB is a powerful library in Java that allows you to implement runtime method access control. By intercepting method calls and applying your access control logic, you can prevent certain methods from being invoked based on various conditions. This provides a flexible way to control method access at runtime in your Java applications.
