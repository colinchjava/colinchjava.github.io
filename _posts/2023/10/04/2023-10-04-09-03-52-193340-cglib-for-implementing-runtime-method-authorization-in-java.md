With the rise of microservices and distributed systems, ensuring secure access to specific methods at runtime has become crucial. One way to achieve this in Java is by leveraging the power of CGLIB, a popular bytecode manipulation library.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use CGLIB to implement runtime method authorization in Java applications. We will start by understanding what CGLIB is and why it is a valuable tool for this purpose. Then, we will dive into the implementation details and provide an example to showcase its usage.

## Introduction

In many applications, access to certain methods needs to be restricted based on various factors such as user roles or permissions. While some frameworks provide declarative authorization mechanisms, they may not be flexible enough for all scenarios.

CGLIB, a bytecode manipulation library, allows us to generate dynamic proxies for classes at runtime. This dynamic proxy generation enables us to intercept method calls and impose custom authorization logic before allowing their execution.

## What is CGLIB?

CGLIB (Code Generation Library) is a powerful Java library that provides APIs for generating and manipulating Java bytecode. It is widely used in frameworks and libraries, such as Spring, to implement advanced features like AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).

With CGLIB, we can create dynamic proxies for classes and intercept method invocations. This allows us to modify or add behavior to existing classes at runtime. By leveraging CGLIB, we can implement runtime method authorization and apply custom security checks before invoking methods.

## Runtime Method Authorization with CGLIB

To implement runtime method authorization using CGLIB, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the methods that require authorization.
2. Create an authorization interceptor to check if the caller has the necessary privileges.
3. Use CGLIB to dynamically generate a proxy class that intercepts method calls.
4. Apply the authorization interceptor logic before invoking the original method.

## Implementation Example

Let's consider an example where we have a banking application with a `TransferService` class that exposes a `transfer` method. We want to restrict access to this method based on the user's role. Here's how we can implement it using CGLIB:

```java
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.Enhancer;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodInterceptor;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy;

// TransferService interface
public interface TransferService {
    void transfer(double amount, String sourceAccount, String targetAccount);
}

// Actual implementation of TransferService
public class TransferServiceImpl implements TransferService {
    @Override
    public void transfer(double amount, String sourceAccount, String targetAccount) {
        // Transfer logic goes here
    }
}

// Authorization interceptor
public class AuthorizationInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {
    private String requiredRole;

    public AuthorizationInterceptor(String requiredRole) {
        this.requiredRole = requiredRole;
    }

    @Override
    public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable {
        // Perform authorization checks here
        if (UserContext.getCurrentUserRole().equals(requiredRole)) {
            return proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args); // Invoke the original method
        } else {
            throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("Access denied");
        }
    }
}

// Dynamic proxy generation using CGLIB
public class TransferServiceProxyFactory {
    public static TransferService createProxy(String requiredRole) {
        Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer();
        enhancer.setSuperclass(TransferServiceImpl.class);
        enhancer.setCallback(new AuthorizationInterceptor(requiredRole));
        return (TransferService) enhancer.create();
    }
}
```

In the above example, we define the `TransferService` interface and its implementation `TransferServiceImpl`. We also create an `AuthorizationInterceptor` class that checks the user's role before allowing the `transfer` method to be invoked.

To generate a dynamic proxy for `TransferService`, we use the `Enhancer` class from CGLIB. We set the superclass to `TransferServiceImpl` and provide our `AuthorizationInterceptor` as the callback. Finally, we create an instance of the proxy using `enhancer.create()`.

Now, when clients invoke the `transfer` method on the dynamically generated proxy, the authorization interceptor will first validate the user's role before allowing the method execution.

## Conclusion

CGLIB provides a powerful way to implement runtime method authorization in Java applications. By generating dynamic proxies, we can intercept method calls and impose custom authorization logic. This enables us to secure runtime access to methods based on dynamic factors such as user roles or permissions.

In this blog post, we explored what CGLIB is, why it is valuable for implementing runtime method authorization, and provided an example of its usage. By leveraging CGLIB, you can enhance the security of your Java applications and ensure that only authorized users can access specific methods.
