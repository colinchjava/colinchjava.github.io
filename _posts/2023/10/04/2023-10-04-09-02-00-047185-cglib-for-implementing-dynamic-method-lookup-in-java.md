CGLIB, or Code Generation Library, is a popular Java library that allows dynamic code generation and method invocation at runtime. It is based on the ASM (Abstract Syntax Tree) framework and provides a simple API for generating and manipulating bytecode.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use CGLIB to implement dynamic method lookup in Java. This technique is helpful when you want to lookup and invoke methods dynamically at runtime, without having to explicitly write code for each method invocation.

## Introduction to CGLIB

CGLIB is a powerful code generation library that acts as an extension to the Java Reflection API. It allows you to create classes and generate bytecode dynamically, making it possible to invoke methods at runtime without having a concrete implementation at compile time.

## Installation and Setup

To use CGLIB in your Java project, you need to add the CGLIB library as a dependency. If you are using Maven, you can include the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>cglib</groupId>
    <artifactId>cglib</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, you can add the following line to your `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation 'cglib:cglib:3.3.0'
```

Once you have added the dependency, you are ready to start using CGLIB in your project.

## Implementing Dynamic Method Lookup

To demonstrate dynamic method lookup using CGLIB, let's consider a scenario where we have a `Calculator` interface with multiple implementation classes. We want to dynamically invoke a specific method on the implementation class based on user input.

Here's an example of how we can implement dynamic method lookup using CGLIB:

```java
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.Enhancer;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodInterceptor;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy;

import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class MethodLookupExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calculator = createProxy();
        calculator.calculate(10, 20); // Dynamic method invocation
    }

    private static Calculator createProxy() {
        Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer();
        enhancer.setSuperclass(CalculatorImpl.class);
        enhancer.setCallback(new MethodInterceptor() {
            @Override
            public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable {
                System.out.println("Before method invocation");
                Object result = proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args);
                System.out.println("After method invocation");
                return result;
            }
        });
        return (Calculator) enhancer.create();
    }
}

interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int a, int b);
}

class CalculatorImpl implements Calculator {
    @Override
    public int calculate(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a dynamic proxy using CGLIB's `Enhancer` class. We set the superclass of the proxy to the implementation class (`CalculatorImpl`) and provide a `MethodInterceptor` that intercepts method invocations on the proxy.

Inside the `MethodInterceptor`, we have access to the `Method` object and can perform custom logic before and after method invocation. In this example, we print a message before and after invoking the method.

## Example Usage

When you run the above example, you will see the following output:

```
Before method invocation
After method invocation
```

This demonstrates that the method invocation is happening dynamically using CGLIB's proxy.

You can extend this example by implementing a more complex logic to determine the method to invoke dynamically based on user input or any other dynamic condition.

## Conclusion

CGLIB is a powerful library for implementing dynamic method lookup in Java. It allows you to generate code at runtime and invoke methods dynamically without the need for a concrete implementation at compile time. By using CGLIB, you can add flexibility and extensibility to your Java applications.

By leveraging CGLIB and its dynamic method lookup capabilities, you can build more flexible and dynamic systems that adapt to runtime conditions. This can be useful in scenarios such as plugin architectures, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and more.

With the ability to generate and manipulate bytecode at runtime, CGLIB opens up a new realm of possibilities for dynamic behavior in Java applications.
