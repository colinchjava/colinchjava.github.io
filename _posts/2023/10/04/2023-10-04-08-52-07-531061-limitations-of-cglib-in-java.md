CGLIB (Code Generation Library) is a popular bytecode generation library for Java. It is widely used in frameworks such as Spring to provide proxy-based AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) functionality. However, despite its usefulness, CGLIB has some limitations that developers should be aware of.

In this blog post, we will explore these limitations and discuss alternative approaches when CGLIB is not suitable.

## 1. Final classes and methods

CGLIB relies on bytecode manipulation to generate proxy classes. However, it cannot generate proxies for *final* classes or methods. This limitation is due to the fact that final classes and methods cannot be subclassed or overridden, which is necessary for CGLIB to generate the proxy.

To overcome this limitation, one possible solution is to use interfaces instead of concrete classes. Interfaces can be easily proxied by CGLIB, allowing for AOP functionality. Another option is to use alternative byte manipulation libraries, such as Byte Buddy or Javassist, which can handle final classes and methods.

## 2. Performance overhead

Due to the bytecode manipulation involved, using CGLIB can introduce performance overhead compared to using plain Java classes. The dynamic nature of proxy creation can result in slower method invocations and object creation.

If performance is a critical concern, it is worth considering other alternatives, such as using compile-time AOP weaving with tools like AspectJ. This approach weaves the aspect code into the target classes during the compilation process, resulting in optimized performance.

## 3. No support for constructors

CGLIB does not support proxying constructors. This means that if you have logic within the constructor of your class that you want to intercept or modify, it cannot be done using CGLIB.

To work around this limitation, you can refactor the logic into separate methods and use CGLIB to proxy those methods instead. Alternatively, you can consider using other AOP frameworks like AspectJ that provide constructor interception capabilities.

## Conclusion

While CGLIB is a powerful library for generating proxies in Java, it does have its limitations. It cannot generate proxies for final classes or methods, introduces performance overhead, and lacks support for constructor interception.

Understanding these limitations is crucial when deciding whether to use CGLIB or explore alternative approaches for your specific use case. By weighing the pros and cons and considering the trade-offs, you can make an informed decision on the best approach for your project.
