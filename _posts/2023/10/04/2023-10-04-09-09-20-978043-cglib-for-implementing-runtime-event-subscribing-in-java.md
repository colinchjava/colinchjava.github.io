In Java, event-driven programming is a common paradigm used to handle asynchronous, non-blocking interactions. One approach to achieve this is by using event subscribers, where different components can subscribe to events and be notified when those events occur.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement runtime event subscribing in Java using CGLIB.

## What is CGLIB?

CGLIB (Code Generation Library) is a powerful library in the Java ecosystem that allows runtime generation of Java proxy classes. It works by dynamically generating classes at runtime by subclassing target classes and intercepting method calls. CGLIB is often used in frameworks like Spring to provide proxy-based AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) functionality.

## Implementing Runtime Event Subscribing

To implement runtime event subscribing using CGLIB, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define an event class that represents the event being fired.

2. Create a subscriber class that contains the logic to handle the event.

3. Use CGLIB to generate a proxy class that intercepts the event firing and invokes the subscriber's event handling method.

4. Register the subscriber with the proxy to receive events.

5. Fire events from the proxy class, which will invoke the subscriber's event handling method.

CGLIB simplifies this process by providing a convenient API to generate proxy classes.

## Example Code

Let's see an example of how to implement runtime event subscribing using CGLIB in Java:

```java
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.Enhancer;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodInterceptor;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy;

import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class EventProxy implements MethodInterceptor {

    private List<Object> subscribers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void subscribe(Object subscriber) {
        subscribers.add(subscriber);
    }

    public void fireEvent() {
        for (Object subscriber : subscribers) {
            Method method = findMethod(subscriber.getClass(), "handleEvent");
            invokeMethod(subscriber, method);
        }
    }

    private Method findMethod(Class<?> clazz, String methodName) {
        for (Method method : clazz.getDeclaredMethods()) {
            if (method.getName().equals(methodName)) {
                return method;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    private void invokeMethod(Object target, Method method) {
        try {
            method.invoke(target);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static <T> T createProxy(Class<T> clazz) {
        Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer();
        enhancer.setSuperclass(clazz);
        enhancer.setCallback(new EventProxy());
        return (T) enhancer.create();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EventProxy eventProxy = new EventProxy();
        SubscriberA subscriberA = new SubscriberA();
        SubscriberB subscriberB = new SubscriberB();

        eventProxy.subscribe(subscriberA);
        eventProxy.subscribe(subscriberB);

        EventPublisher eventPublisher = createProxy(EventPublisher.class);
        eventPublisher.fireEvent();
    }
}

class EventPublisher {
    public void fireEvent() {
        EventProxy eventProxy = new EventProxy();
        eventProxy.fireEvent();
    }
}

class SubscriberA {
    public void handleEvent() {
        System.out.println("Subscriber A handles the event");
    }
}

class SubscriberB {
    public void handleEvent() {
        System.out.println("Subscriber B handles the event");
    }
}
```

In the example above, we create a class `EventProxy` that acts as the event bus. It maintains a list of subscribers and provides methods to subscribe and fire events.

The `EventProxy` class uses CGLIB to generate a proxy class for the `EventPublisher` class. When the `fireEvent()` method is called on the proxy, it invokes the `handleEvent()` method on all the registered subscribers.

In the `main()` method, we create an instance of the `EventProxy`, subscribe two subscribers (`SubscriberA` and `SubscriberB`), and fire an event using the proxy.

## Conclusion

Using CGLIB, we can easily implement runtime event subscribing in Java. CGLIB provides a powerful mechanism to generate proxy classes at runtime, allowing us to intercept method calls and implement event-driven behavior.

By following the steps outlined in this blog post and using the example code provided, you can leverage CGLIB in your Java applications to enable runtime event subscribing. Enjoy the benefits of event-driven programming in your projects!
