In object-oriented programming, method interception is a powerful technique that allows you to modify the behavior of methods in a class without making any changes to its source code. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to add additional functionality, such as logging, caching, or security checks, to existing classes.

CGLIB (Code Generation Library) is a widely used Java library that provides a high-level API for generating dynamic proxy classes at runtime. It is commonly used in frameworks like Spring or Hibernate to implement features like AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).

In this blog post, we'll explore how to use CGLIB to intercept methods in Java classes.

## Setting Up CGLIB

First, you'll need to add the CGLIB dependency to your project. You can do this by adding the following Maven or Gradle dependency to your project's build file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>cglib</groupId>
  <artifactId>cglib</artifactId>
  <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'cglib:cglib:3.3.0'
}
```

## Creating an Interceptor Class

To intercept methods using CGLIB, you'll need to create a class that implements the `MethodInterceptor` interface from the CGLIB library. This interface has a single method `intercept`, which is called when a method is invoked on the intercepted object. Inside this method, you can modify the behavior of the method or perform any additional actions you desire.

Here's an example of an `ExampleInterceptor` class that implements the `MethodInterceptor` interface:

```java
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodInterceptor;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy;

import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class ExampleInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {
    @Override
    public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable {
        // Perform interception logic here
        System.out.println("Before method execution");
        Object result = proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args);
        System.out.println("After method execution");
        return result;
    }
}
```

In the `intercept` method, we can see that we have access to the intercepted object (`obj`), the invoked method (`method`), the method arguments (`args`), and the `MethodProxy` object (`proxy`), which we can use to invoke the original method.

## Creating the Proxy Object

Once you have an interceptor class, you can use it to create a proxy object that intercepts the methods of a target class. To do this, you'll need to use the `Enhancer` class from the CGLIB library.

Here's an example of how to create a proxy object using CGLIB and the `ExampleInterceptor` class:

```java
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.Enhancer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the target class
        TargetClass target = new TargetClass();

        // Create an enhancer object
        Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer();

        // Set the target class as the superclass for the proxy object
        enhancer.setSuperclass(TargetClass.class);

        // Set the interceptor for the enhancer
        enhancer.setCallback(new ExampleInterceptor());

        // Create the proxy object
        TargetClass proxy = (TargetClass) enhancer.create();

        // Interact with the proxy object
        proxy.methodToIntercept();
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create an instance of the target class, `TargetClass`. Then, we create an `Enhancer` object and set the target class as the superclass for the proxy object. We also set the `ExampleInterceptor` as the callback object for the enhancer. Finally, we create the proxy object using the `create` method.

When we call the `methodToIntercept` method on the proxy object, the `intercept` method of the `ExampleInterceptor` class will be invoked before and after the method execution.

## Conclusion

Method interception with CGLIB provides a powerful way to modify the behavior of Java objects at runtime. By creating an interceptor class that implements the `MethodInterceptor` interface from CGLIB, you can intercept and modify the behavior of methods in a target class. CGLIB's `Enhancer` class allows you to create proxy objects that intercept method invocations.

Using method interception can greatly enhance the functionality and flexibility of your Java applications, enabling you to add additional behavior to existing classes without modifying their source code.
