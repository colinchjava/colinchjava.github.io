Proxying final classes in Java can be a challenge since they cannot be directly subclassed. However, with the help of **CGLIB**, a third-party library, it is possible to create proxies for final classes.

## What is CGLIB?

CGLIB is a powerful library for creating dynamic proxies in Java. It works by generating bytecode at runtime, allowing you to create proxies for classes that cannot be subclassed.

## How to use CGLIB for proxying final classes

To use CGLIB for proxying final classes, you need to follow these steps:

1. Add the CGLIB dependency to your project. You can do this by adding the following Maven dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>cglib</groupId>
       <artifactId>cglib</artifactId>
       <version>3.3.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Create a **MethodInterceptor** implementation that will intercept method calls on the final class. This interceptor will be responsible for adding the desired behavior to the proxy.

   ```java
   import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodInterceptor;
   import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy;

   public class MyMethodInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {
       @Override
       public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable {
           // Add your custom logic here
           // You can delegate the method call to the original object or modify the behavior
           return proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args);
       }
   }
   ```

3. Use CGLIB to create a proxy for the final class. In the example below, we assume the final class is named `FinalClass`:

   ```java
   import net.sf.cglib.proxy.Enhancer;

   public class ProxyExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Create an instance of the final class
           FinalClass finalClass = new FinalClass();

           // Create the enhancer, which will be responsible for creating the proxy
           Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer();
           enhancer.setSuperclass(FinalClass.class);
           enhancer.setCallback(new MyMethodInterceptor());

           // Create the proxy for the final class
           FinalClass proxy = (FinalClass) enhancer.create();

           // Use the proxy as if it was the original final class
           proxy.someMethod();
       }
   }
   ```

   In the above code, `FinalClass` is the original final class, and `proxy` is the generated proxy. We set the `MyMethodInterceptor` as the callback for the enhancer, which will intercept method calls on the proxy.

4. Run your code and observe the intercepted behavior. The `intercept` method in the `MyMethodInterceptor` implementation will be called whenever a method is invoked on the proxy.

## Conclusion

Using CGLIB, it is possible to create proxies for final classes in Java. This allows you to add custom behavior, modify method calls, or implement any other custom logic for classes that cannot be subclassed directly. CGLIB's bytecode generation capabilities make it a powerful tool for dynamic proxying in Java.
