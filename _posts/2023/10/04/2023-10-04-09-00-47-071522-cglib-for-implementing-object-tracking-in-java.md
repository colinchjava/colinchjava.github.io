When working with Java, it is often useful to track objects and their state changes for various purposes such as debugging, profiling, or even for creating advanced frameworks. One way to achieve this is by using the CGLIB library, which offers powerful features for dynamic code generation and object manipulation in Java.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement object tracking using CGLIB in Java, discussing the key concepts and providing example code to help you get started.

## What is CGLIB?

CGLIB, short for Code Generation Library, is a powerful library that provides a high-level API for generating enhanced Java bytecode at runtime. It is commonly used for creating dynamic proxies, method interception, and even for implementing advanced features like object tracking.

CGLIB operates by creating a subclass of the target object and intercepting method invocations to perform additional logic or modifications. This dynamic subclass can be used to override methods, add new ones, or in our case, track the object's state changes.

## Implementing Object Tracking with CGLIB

To implement object tracking with CGLIB, we will create a `TrackedObject` class that wraps the target object and tracks its state changes. Let's dive into the implementation details!

### Creating a TrackedObject

First, we need to create a class that extends the `TrackedObject` using CGLIB. This class will serve as a wrapper around the target object and will intercept method invocations to track state changes.

```java
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.Enhancer;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodInterceptor;
import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy;

public class TrackedObject<T> implements MethodInterceptor {
  
    private T target;
   
    public TrackedObject(T target) {
        this.target = target;
    }

    public T getTrackedObject() {
        Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer();
        enhancer.setSuperclass(target.getClass());
        enhancer.setCallback(this);
        return (T) enhancer.create();
    }

    @Override
    public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable {
        // Perform desired tracking logic here
        System.out.println("Method " + method.getName() + " called on object " + target);
        Object result = proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args);
        // Perform additional tracking logic here
        return result;
    }
}
```

In the `TrackedObject` class, we implement the `MethodInterceptor` interface provided by CGLIB. This interface allows us to intercept and modify method invocations made on the object being tracked.

### Tracking Object State Changes

Next, we need to create the object we want to track and wrap it using the `TrackedObject` class.

```java
public class Main {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John", 25);
        
        TrackedObject<Person> trackedPerson = new TrackedObject<>(person);
        Person trackedObject = trackedPerson.getTrackedObject();
        
        trackedObject.setName("Mike");
        trackedObject.setAge(30);
    }
}

class Person {
  
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // constructor and getters/setters here
}
```

In the above code snippet, we create a `Person` class with `name` and `age` properties. We then instantiate a `TrackedObject<Person>` and use the `getTrackedObject()` method to get a tracked version of the `person` object.

After obtaining the tracked object, we can perform modifications on its properties. Each modification will be intercepted by the `TrackedObject` class, where we can implement custom tracking logic. In the example code, we simply print out the method name and object reference.

## Conclusion

Object tracking is a valuable technique in Java, and CGLIB provides a reliable and flexible way to implement it. By leveraging CGLIB's dynamic code generation capabilities, you can easily track object state changes and perform custom logic as needed.

In this blog post, we explored how to implement object tracking using CGLIB in Java. We discussed the key concepts, provided example code, and explained the steps involved in creating a `TrackedObject`. With this knowledge, you can incorporate object tracking into your Java projects and enhance your debugging and profiling capabilities.
