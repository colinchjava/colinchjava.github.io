CGLIB is a dynamic proxy library for Java that allows us to create runtime method invocations. It is commonly used in frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate to implement AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) features.

## What is CGLIB?

CGLIB stands for Code Generation Library. It is a widely-used open-source library that provides code generation functionality for Java applications. It is built upon the ASM (Abstract Syntax Tree Manipulation) library, and it generates bytecode at runtime to create dynamic proxy classes.

## Why use CGLIB for runtime method invocation?

CGLIB provides a powerful way to create a proxy object that intercepts method invocations. This proxy object can be used to add additional behavior before or after the original method is called. It allows us to implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, and transaction management without modifying the original class.

## How to use CGLIB for runtime method invocation

To use CGLIB for runtime method invocation, follow these steps:

1. Add the CGLIB dependency to your project. You can include it using Maven or Gradle:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>cglib</groupId>
       <artifactId>cglib</artifactId>
       <version>3.3.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Create an interface or extend the target class with `MethodInterceptor` from CGLIB:

   ```java
   import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodInterceptor;
   import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy;

   public class MyInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {
       @Override
       public Object intercept(Object object, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy methodProxy) throws Throwable {
           // Add your custom logic here
           String methodName = method.getName();
           System.out.println("Intercepted method: " + methodName);
           
           // Invoke the original method
           Object result = methodProxy.invokeSuper(object, args);
           
           // Add any additional logic after the method execution
           
           return result;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Create a proxy object using CGLIB's Enhancer class and set the target object and interceptor:

   ```java
   import net.sf.cglib.proxy.Enhancer;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyTargetClass target = new MyTargetClass();
           Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer();
           enhancer.setSuperclass(MyTargetClass.class);
           enhancer.setCallback(new MyInterceptor());
           MyTargetClass proxy = (MyTargetClass) enhancer.create();
           
           // Now, use the proxy object instead of the original object
           proxy.someMethod();
       }
   }
   ```

In the above code, `MyTargetClass` is the class on which we want to implement runtime method invocation, `MyInterceptor` is the method interceptor that defines the custom logic to be executed before and after the method invocation, and `Enhancer` is used to create the proxy object.

## Conclusion

CGLIB provides a powerful way to implement runtime method invocation in Java. It allows us to create dynamic proxy objects that intercept method invocations and add custom logic before or after the original method execution. By using CGLIB, we can easily implement cross-cutting concerns and enhance our application's functionality without modifying the original code.

Remember to bundle the CGLIB library with your application and handle any potential compatibility issues with other libraries or frameworks in your project.
